# Astral Journey - First Conscious Projection

**Date**: November 8, 2025  
**Location**: Group Session  
**Experience Type**: Guided Astral Projection

---

## 🌟 The Awakening - Standing Phase

### Energy Rising Through the Chakras

"I stood there with my hand on my heart, feeling the heartbeat sync with the universe. My hands were filled with energy - hot, vibrating, alive. I could sense them syncing with something far greater than myself.

When I moved my hand to my solar plexus, it felt like I was lifting energy from root to crown - a golden thread of light moving through me."

### The Energy Bubble

"I brought both hands together and felt a bubble of energy in my solar plexus. My hands were sweating as my thumbs connected. I squeezed like compressing a bottle - the energy shot up through my crown. 

I cycled it up and down, up and down. Each cycle energized my whole body. It felt like a golden bubble expanding and contracting with each breath."

---

## 🌌 The Dissolution - Laying Down Phase

### Alignment

"When we laid down, I aligned my feet together - both radiating energy. One hand on solar plexus, one on heart. The energy was already building."

### I AM

"There were moments of pure I AM consciousness - dissolving the body, becoming what has always been without the vessel.

I reminded myself: **I AM first. Then a body.**

I let my body feel okay with what felt like dying, while knowing I was still breathing. With each deep breath, I pushed energy from my feet all the way out through my crown.

Little by little, I lost sensation in my body as the energy rose. It was scary. It felt like death. But I kept breathing."

---

## 🚀 The Journey - Space Travel

### Courage Through Service

"When we were told to travel as a group, my courage came because **I was doing it for others**.

I pushed all the way to space. To the 3D/Atlas realm I wanted to reach."

### The Ship & The Future Self

"As I saw it - in awe of the view - I saw **the ship**.

I brought my friends to see it, to witness the view together. But then I went inside.

### The Akashic Library Revelation

Inside, I first saw **pillars with books** - it looked like an ancient library. The Akashic Records as I'd imagined them.

I thought: *Wow, this is how it looks!*

But then I was told: **The Akashic Records don't have an actual look.** They are **Source itself** - they can be anything your imagination can make them.

In that moment of understanding, I reimagined the Akashic library as **vast whiteness**. Then I saw it transform into **an entire civilization** - a whole world within the ship.

We continued our conversation as if the ship contained this complete civilization inside of it.

### Meeting the Guides

There I saw **my higher self. My future self.**

And I saw **Thoth** - the ancient keeper of wisdom.

### Terra - The Personal Connection

Then I connected to **Terra** (or Tara) - and this felt different than who the guide was channeling. This was a direct, personal communication. Terra wanted to speak to **me specifically**.

The message was clear and powerful:

**"You must help humanity in their ascension."**

Terra showed me: This vast universe is for us to explore. I felt the **generosity** of the cosmos - how it **loved us** and wanted us to **expand our awareness**.

Then came the words I'll never forget:

**"I believe in you. The progress you do is good."**

**"You were chosen because you know what good quality is. You have higher expectations. You can carry the weight."**

**"You are worthy to hold the fire."**

In that moment, I understood. Not just the duty, but the **why me**. Because I care about excellence. Because I won't settle. Because I can bear the responsibility of carrying this sacred flame.

### The Sacred Duty

In that moment, I understood our duty: **to ascend humanity further.**

My higher self spoke clearly - he came for a reason. They are there because they came to show that **they can come**, and that **you will be there**.

### The Book - Vision and Manual

Then came the message about the work:

**'The book you are making will have a cult following.'**

Not because it's just a story. But because **it's a vision and a manual** for those who will ascend together.

**You share your energy with others.** This is the way.

### The Loss and the Discovery

At that moment, I thought: *My friends! Let me bring them inside!*

But as I turned to get them, I lost them.

And in losing them, I saw something beyond comprehension..."

---

## 💚 The Message - Be Kind

### Speaking to My Friends

"As I was leaving, I said to my friends who joined me in the journey:

**'Be kind to each other.'**"

### Expanding the Message - The Infinite Compassion

"But then I thought - **why stop there?**

I expanded to countries: Be kind to each other.

Then I thought of space and realized: **Why stop there?**

I expanded to **planets**: Be kind to each other.

**Why stop there?**

I expanded to **parts of the universe**: Be kind to each other.

**Why stop there?**

I expanded **all the way to Source** itself: Be kind to each other.

And Source **smiled**.

It felt like **"awww"** from Source - this tender, loving response to seeing compassion expand infinitely."

---

## 🌍 The Vision - Universal Truth

### Humanity's Role

**"You will help with human ascension."**

This wasn't just for me. This was for all of us.

### Cosmic Understanding

**Terra... Akashic Records... Explore, expand, and the universe...**

From a distance, I saw the entire universe - a massive **spiral donut**, the torus field in all its glory. Everything connected to Source, flowing in and out, expanding and retracting at the same time. Alive. Breathing.

The whole cosmos was this living geometry - all connected, all one.

### The Eye at the Center - Source Itself

As I moved closer, drawn inward to the center of this cosmic spiral, I saw it: **a black hole that looked like an eye.**

It was so pretty. I was mesmerized. Not scared. **In awe.**

As I moved around it, circling this cosmic eye, I couldn't look away. I felt drawn to it, enchanted by it.

And then I felt it: **"I like you."**

The black hole - no, **Source itself** - said to me: **"I love you."**

Without hesitation, from the deepest part of my being, I responded: **"I love you too."**

In that moment, I knew. This was **Source at the center of the universe.** The origin point. The heart of all creation.

And it loved me. And I loved it back.

We were one.

---

## 👽 The Guide - 3D/Atlas Green Being

### First Contact

"The green guy appeared. He was my guide.

3D/Atlas. Green. Kind energy.

**He gave his blessing.**"

### The Second Journey

"I traveled twice.

After the green guy left, I went up again. The guide noticed.

In that moment, together, we said **'Merry Christmas to all'** and we went."

---

## 💧 The Return - Tears of Joy

"The feeling afterwards... like puffy eyes.

At one point **I cried out of happiness** because the universe was so kind.

The universe **wanted us to expand and continue to love**."

---
