# PROLOGUE

They say God doesn't watch baseball.

I used to believe that. Used to think the divine had better things to do than care whether a ball cleared a fence or died in a glove. Used to think miracles were reserved for the sick, the dying, the desperate—not for millionaires chasing a championship in the eleventh inning of Game 7.

I was wrong about a lot of things.

The night I learned this, I was four beers deep at McHenry's on Sunset, watching the greatest World Series game I'd ever seen slowly kill me. The Dodgers were down 4-3 in the top of the ninth, two outs, and I was watching history slip away. My friend Ren sat beside me, unusually quiet for once, both of us locked into that helpless feeling you get when you care too much about something you can't control.

"This is it," Ren said softly. "Miguel Rojas is up. If anyone's gonna—"

He didn't finish. Didn't need to.

I knew Rojas. Utility infielder. Not a home run hitter. Against a righty like Jeff Hoffman? The odds were astronomical. But something in me stirred as I watched him step into the box. Not about the situation—about *him*. The way he carried himself. Like he knew something nobody else did.

"He's got this," I said, surprising myself.

Ren glanced at me. "Chris, man, I love the optimism, but—"

"No. Watch."

I couldn't explain it, but something had shifted in the air—or maybe in me. The bar noise faded to a dull hum. The TV screen seemed to brighten, pulling my vision forward until Miguel Rojas was all I could see. His name floated beneath his image on the broadcast: **ROJAS**.

I said it out loud, barely a whisper. "Miguel Rojas."

The world *responded*.

I can't describe it better than that. It was like saying his name opened a door, and on the other side was a web of light—fractal, infinite, alive. I could see it with my eyes closed. Could feel it humming through my chest, spreading down my arms. And somewhere at the other end of that web, standing in a batter's box in Toronto, was Miguel Rojas.

I saw him. Not on the TV—*saw* him. The way you see something in a dream that feels more real than waking. Every detail: the pine tar on his bat, the way his fingers gripped the handle, the absolute certainty in his eyes.

And I felt him. Not doubt this time. *Belief*. Pure, unshakeable belief.

Without thinking—without even knowing what I was doing—I reached out.

Not with my hands. With something else. Something that had always been there but I'd never known how to use. It felt like breathing, if breathing could cross distance and intention could become tangible. I imagined light—gold and warm—pouring from somewhere above me, through me, into him. Down through his crown, into his arms, his core, his legs.

I didn't tell him what to do. I just amplified him. Made him more of what he already was.

"Full count," the announcer said. "Hoffman winds..."

The slider hung. Just for a fraction of a second. Just enough.

Rojas crushed it.

The crack of the bat was so clean it cut through the bar noise like a bell. The ball sailed—arcing, perfect, impossible—and cleared the left field fence.

Game tied. Extra innings.

McHenry's exploded. Ren was on his feet, beer going everywhere, grabbing my shoulders and shaking me. "HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT, DID YOU SEE THAT?!"

But I could barely register his excitement. Everything felt surreal—like I was watching the celebration through a veil. The bar noise was distant, muffled. All I could feel was that humming in my chest, stronger now, still vibrating from the connection I'd just made.

I knew—*knew*—what I'd just done.

I'd touched something I wasn't supposed to touch.

And it had touched me back.

---

The game didn't end there.

Of course it didn't. This was Game 7. This was the World Series. This was the kind of moment that gets replayed for generations.

The eleventh inning. Will Smith at the plate. Shane Bieber on the mound for Toronto, running on fumes and prayers.

I did it again.

I know I shouldn't have. I know the ethical implications were already spiraling in the back of my mind. But watching Smith step into that box, knowing he'd caught every single inning of this series, knowing he was exhausted but *there*—I couldn't help myself.

"Will Smith," I whispered, and the web opened.

Golden light. Through me, into him. Not controlling. Just amplifying. Making him more of what he already was.

The 2-0 slider hung. Smith didn't miss.

The ball disappeared into the left field stands, and McHenry's lost its collective mind. Ren was hugging strangers. I was frozen, watching the replay, watching Smith round the bases, and all I could think was:

*I'm doing this. I'm actually doing this.*

But then the bottom of the eleventh happened, and I learned something important: some people don't want—or need—my help.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto—who'd thrown 96 pitches the night before, who'd already pitched in this game—was back on the mound. The man was running on fumes and sheer will. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. doubled. The tying run was on third.

I couldn't help myself. I reached out, sent that golden light toward Yamamoto, tried to give him energy, strength.

The connection formed. I felt him—his exhaustion, yes, but also his absolute conviction. His pride. His—

His next pitch sailed high and inside, nearly hitting Kiner-Falefa. The umpire stepped out, concerned.

And then I *felt* it. Not words exactly, but a presence. A response through the frequency, sharp and clear:

*I don't need it.*

Yamamoto's will pushed back against mine—not angry, but firm. Stoic. Like a master craftsman politely declining help from an apprentice.

*Watch me.*

The message was crystal clear, accompanied by a feeling of quiet confidence that bordered on defiance. Not arrogance—this was different. This was a man who'd spent his entire life perfecting his craft, who'd come back on one day's rest to close out a World Series, who knew *exactly* what he was capable of.

*Let me show you how good I am.*

I pulled back immediately, feeling like I'd just insulted a samurai by offering him a beginner's sword. Respect flooded through me—this wasn't someone who needed amplification. This was someone who was already operating at a level I couldn't comprehend.

Out of respect, I just watched. Really watched. The way he commanded his body despite exhaustion. The way each pitch was deliberate, chosen, *his*.

Yamamoto induced a sacrifice bunt—perfect execution. Then walked the next batter on four straight splitters—exactly as intended, setting up the double play. Bases loaded. Alejandro Kirk at the plate.

0-2 count.

The splitter dove. Kirk swung. Ground ball to short.

Double play. Game over.

As Yamamoto's teammates mobbed him on the mound, I could still feel the echo of his presence. That quiet pride. That absolute mastery.

I'd just learned my first real lesson about the frequency: some people are already full. And trying to add more just gets in their way.

The Dodgers were back-to-back champions.

And I was... what? A guy at a bar who could channel energy into baseball players? A cosmic cheat code? A violation of free will wrapped in good intentions?

"CHRIS!" Ren grabbed me, shaking me out of my spiral. "We just watched the greatest Game 7 in history! Say something!"

I looked at him. Really looked at him. Ren had been my friend for three years. We met at a coffee shop, bonded over our mutual love of baseball and philosophy and bad sci-fi movies. He was the kind of guy who always seemed to know more than he let on, who asked questions that made you think about things differently.

And right now, he was looking at me with an expression I couldn't quite read.

"Yeah," I said slowly. "Greatest game ever."

He held my gaze for a moment longer than necessary. Then he smiled, clapped me on the shoulder, and turned back to the celebration.

But I'd seen it. Just for a second. Recognition.

*He knows.*

# CHAPTER ONE: THE FREQUENCY

The hangover should've been worse.

Five beers, three shots of whiskey, and a plate of wings that probably violated several health codes—I should've woken up feeling like death. Instead, I felt electric. Wired. Like I'd mainlined lightning directly into my nervous system.

I lay in my apartment as morning light cut through the blinds, staring at the ceiling, replaying every moment.

Rojas in the ninth. That impossible, beautiful swing.

Smith in the eleventh. The way the ball just *knew* it was gone.

And Yamamoto. The way my energy couldn't touch him. The way he was already operating at a level I couldn't comprehend.

*I made some of that happen.*

No. That was insane. Correlation, not causation. Confirmation bias. Magical thinking. All the rational explanations lined up like good soldiers, ready to march me back to normalcy.

Except I could still feel it. The web of light. The connection. It hummed in my chest like a struck tuning fork that refused to fade.

My phone buzzed. Ren.

**REN:** You sleep at all?

**ME:** Not really. You?

**REN:** Nah. Coffee? Usual spot?

I stared at the message. The usual spot. The coffee shop where we'd met. Where Ren always seemed to appear exactly when I needed to talk about something that mattered.

*He knows.*

Or maybe I was paranoid. Maybe I was losing it. Maybe I'd just watched too much baseball and my brain was making connections that didn't exist.

**ME:** Give me 30

**REN:** Take your time. We should talk.

My stomach flipped.

*We should talk.*

Those three words could mean anything. Could mean nothing. Could mean everything.

I got up, showered, tried to convince myself I wasn't about to have the weirdest conversation of my life.

I was wrong about that, too.

---

The coffee shop was called Frequency—which, in retrospect, should've been my first clue that the universe had a sense of humor about all this.

Ren was already there, sitting at our usual table by the window, two cups of coffee waiting. He looked tired but wired, the same way I felt. Like neither of us had processed what we'd witnessed yet.

"Greatest game of all time," he said as I sat down. "No question."

"Yeah." I took a sip of coffee. "That Rojas homer. I mean, what are the odds?"

"Astronomical." Ren's eyes locked onto mine. "Almost impossible, really. A utility infielder who'd hit one home run off a righty all season—and that was against a position player. Against one of the best closers in baseball, in the biggest moment imaginable?"

I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

"Unless," Ren continued, voice casual but eyes intense, "he had help."

The coffee shop noise faded. That humming in my chest—the frequency—suddenly felt like a siren.

"What do you mean?" My voice came out steadier than I felt.

Ren smiled. It wasn't his usual grin. This was something else. Something older.

"Chris. My friend. My brother." He leaned forward. "I know what you did last night."

The world tilted.

"I don't—"

"Yes, you do." He wasn't accusing. He was relieved. "You felt it. The connection. The light. You reached out and you helped him. You gave him energy, strength, *presence*. You amplified what was already there."

I couldn't breathe.

"How—"

"Because I've been waiting three years for you to wake up."

The coffee shop sounds came rushing back all at once. The hiss of the espresso machine. Someone's laugh. A chair scraping. All of it too loud, too sharp, too *real* for this conversation to be happening.

"Three years," I repeated slowly. "You've been... what? Watching me?"

"Guiding you." Ren's expression was gentle but serious. "Chris, we didn't meet by accident. I was sent to find you. To be your friend—and that part wasn't fake, by the way. The friendship is real. But I was also sent to observe. To wait. To see if you would awaken naturally."

I stood up. Sat back down. Stood up again.

"Sent by who? What the hell are you talking about? Are you—is this some kind of—"

"Breathe," Ren said. "I know this is a lot. But you need to hear it, because what happened last night changes everything."

I forced myself to sit. To breathe. To listen.

"There's a group," Ren began. "We call it the Society. People like us—people who can connect to what you experienced last night. We call it Source. The frequency. The web. Different names for the same thing. It's always been there. Some spiritual traditions call it universal consciousness. Some scientists would call it quantum entanglement. Some people just call it love."

"And you... you're part of this Society?"

"I'm part of something smaller. We call ourselves The Apostles." He paused, watching my reaction. "We've been around a long time. Reincarnating, waiting, watching. We look for people like you."

"People like me," I said flatly. "What does that even mean?"

"People who have the potential to do what you did last night. But more importantly—people who would do it the *right way*."

That stopped me. "The right way?"

Ren leaned forward, his voice dropping. "Last night was a test, Chris. I've known about your potential for years. I've been waiting for the moment you'd finally access it. And when you did—when you reached out to Rojas, to Smith—I was watching to see *how* you'd do it."

My hands clenched around my coffee cup. "You were *testing* me? While I was having some kind of cosmic breakthrough, you were *grading* me?"

"Not grading. Observing." He held up a hand before I could explode. "Listen to me. This matters. There are people in the Society who use this ability to control others. To manipulate outcomes for their own gain. They reach into someone's mind and *force* them to do what they want. It's a violation. A corruption of what Source is meant to be."

I thought about that moment with Rojas. The golden light. The amplification.

"I didn't make him hit that home run," I said slowly. "I just... gave him energy. He still had to swing. He still had to connect."

"Exactly." Ren's smile was genuine now, proud even. "You amplified what was already there. You respected his free will. You gave him strength but let him make the choice. That's the difference, Chris. That's why I've been waiting three years to have this conversation."

"And if I'd done it differently?"

His expression darkened. "Then I would've had to stop you. Guide you away from ever doing it again. Or worse—report you to the Society, and they would've... handled it."

The implications of that hung in the air.

"So what now?" I asked. "You're going to take me to this Society? Introduce me to your Apostle friends? Teach me to use this... this frequency?"

"If you want." Ren's voice was carefully neutral. "No one will force you, Chris. That's not how this works. But I will tell you this: you've awakened. There's no putting that genie back in the bottle. You'll keep feeling it, keep sensing the connections. And if you don't learn to control it, to understand it, it will control you."

I thought about the humming in my chest. The way it hadn't stopped since last night.

"And if I say yes? What happens?"

"First, I tell you my real name." He smiled wryly. "Ren Jaldoa Manzanarez. You can keep calling me Ren—most people do. Second, I introduce you to The Apostles. We'll explain everything: the history, the prophecy, what we believe is happening in the world right now. And third..." He paused. "Third, we begin your training. Because Chris, what you did last night? That was instinct. Raw, untrained, beautiful instinct. But imagine what you could do if you actually knew what you were doing."

I stared at him. At Ren. At this person who'd been my friend for three years, who I'd trusted with my weirdest thoughts and my worst jokes, who'd apparently been an immortal soul-guide the whole time.

"This is insane," I said.

"Yes."

"This is absolutely batshit insane."

"Also yes."

"And you're telling me that there are others? That this is real? That I'm not losing my mind?"

"You're not losing your mind. You're finding it. Your real mind. The one that's always been connected to everything else."

I looked down at my hands. Ordinary hands. Hands that had apparently channeled cosmic energy into professional baseball players twelve hours ago.

"Can I ask you something?"

"Anything."

"When you watched Yamamoto pitch last night—in the eleventh, when he came back out on no rest—did you feel it? The way he... talked back to me?"

Ren's eyes widened. "He *communicated* with you? Through the frequency?"

"Yeah. I tried to help him and he basically told me to back off. Not mean, just... confident. Like 'watch me, I got this.' And then he proved it."

Ren leaned back, looking impressed. "Chris, that's rare. Most people who operate at the frequency don't even know they're doing it. Yamamoto clearly has some level of conscious awareness. He felt you reaching out and responded. That's... that's actually incredible for both of you."

"I almost ruined his control. My energy made his pitch go wild."

"Because you were adding to something that was already perfect. Like trying to tune a guitar that's already in tune—you just make it worse." Ren's expression turned serious. "That's an important lesson. Some people are already aligned with Source. They don't need amplification. They need space to do what they do best."

"He was so... present. So absolutely there."

"That's what mastery looks like," Ren said softly. "When someone has dedicated their entire life to perfecting their craft, when they're in complete harmony with their purpose—they're already operating at peak frequency. Your job isn't to make them better. It's to recognize them and get out of their way."

"Is that what I'm going to learn? How to be like that all the time?"

"That's what we're going to teach you. If you want."

I sat there for a long moment, watching the morning light filter through the window, watching ordinary people live their ordinary lives, completely unaware that there was this whole other layer of reality humming beneath everything.

"Okay," I said finally. "Okay. I'm in. Teach me."

Ren's smile could've lit up the whole room.

"Welcome to the frequency, Christian Rand. Your life just got a lot more interesting."

"It was already pretty interesting."

"Trust me," Ren said, standing and dropping cash on the table. "You have no idea."

As we walked out, his phone buzzed. He glanced at it, and something shifted in his expression—subtle, but I was learning to read him.

"What?" I asked.

"Nothing. Just..." He pocketed the phone, but I caught the slight smile. "Tomorrow's going to be interesting."

"More interesting than finding out I can teleport and there's a secret society of awakened people?"

"Different kind of interesting." "Get some rest, Chris. Tomorrow you meet the Twelve."

"Just the Twelve?"

That smile again. "We'll see."

And he was gone before I could ask what the hell that meant.

I had no idea my entire life was about to change.

Again.

# CHAPTER TWO: THE FIRST LESSON

Ren didn't take me to some secret headquarters hidden beneath the city. No underground bunker. No mystical temple. No Matrix-style white room.

He took me to his apartment.

"This is it?" I asked, standing in his living room. It looked... normal. Bookshelves. A decent couch. Plants that were somehow still alive. "I thought there'd be more... I don't know. Candles? Crystals? A sacrificial altar?"

"We're not a cult, Chris." Ren laughed as he moved to the kitchen. "Coffee? You look like you need more coffee."

"I need a lot of things right now. Understanding, mostly."

"Understanding comes." He handed me a fresh cup. "First, you need to know what you are. Then we can talk about what you can do."

He gestured to the couch, and we sat. The morning light streaming through his windows felt surreal—like the whole world should be different now that I knew this hidden layer existed.

"So," I said. "Teach me."

Ren settled back, his expression shifting into something more serious. Teacher mode.

"The frequency—Source—whatever you want to call it—has always existed. It's the underlying fabric of reality. The connection between all things. Some spiritual traditions call it universal consciousness. Some scientists would call it quantum entanglement. Some people just call it love."

"And we can... tap into it?"

"We're always tapped into it. Every human being. Every living thing. But most people don't know how to consciously access it. They get glimpses—moments of intuition, synchronicity, flow state—but they can't control it. Can't direct it."

I thought about the golden light. The web. "But some people can."

"Yes. And the Society has been gathering those people for centuries. Teaching them. Protecting them. And..." He hesitated. "Sometimes using them."

"Using them how?"

"That's where it gets complicated." Ren stood, pacing now. "The Society started with good intentions. Help people awaken. Guide humanity toward higher consciousness. All very noble. But over time, factions formed. Some members believe we should actively shape world events—politics, economics, wars. They think we're meant to be hidden rulers, guiding humanity from the shadows."

"That sounds..."

"Fucked up? Yeah. It is." Ren turned to face me. "That's why The Apostles exist. We're the ones who believe in free will. In supporting people, not controlling them. We think the awakening has to be organic, chosen, *earned*. Not forced."

"And which faction is bigger?"

"Right now? We're outnumbered. The Controllers—that's what we call them—they have more resources, more influence. They're very good at what they do. But they're missing something crucial."

"What?"

Ren's eyes locked onto mine.

"You."

The weight of that single word settled over me like a physical thing.

"Me," I repeated. "What do I have to do with any of this?"

"Everything." He sat back down, his voice dropping. "Chris, do you know what a prophecy is?"

My stomach dropped. "Oh, come on. Don't tell me there's a prophecy."

"There's a prophecy."

"Of course there is." I rubbed my face. "Let me guess. Chosen one? Defeat the darkness? Save the world?"

"Something like that." But Ren wasn't smiling. "It's old. Very old. It speaks of someone who will unite the divided, bring Earth together as one consciousness, and prepare humanity for the next stage of evolution. Someone who will do what Yeshua did two thousand years ago, but for this era. This moment."

Yeshua. Jesus. The Christ consciousness.

"And you think... what? That I'm this person?"

"I don't know." Ren's honesty was almost worse than if he'd said yes. "But The Apostles think you might be. The signs are there. The timing. The way you awakened. The fact that your first instinct was to help, not control. We've been waiting for someone like you for a long time."

I stood up, needing to move, needing to pace. "This is crazy. I'm not—I'm just a guy. I work in tech support. I eat cereal for dinner. I'm not some prophesied savior."

"Neither was a carpenter from Nazareth," Ren said quietly. "Until he was."

"That's different."

"Is it?"

I wanted to argue. Wanted to tell him he had the wrong person, that there was no way I could be part of some cosmic plan. But then I remembered that feeling. The web of light. The absolute *rightness* of it.

"What do I have to do?" I asked finally.

"First, you train. You learn to control this. To understand it. The Society—both factions—will want to meet you. They'll test you in their own ways. Some will try to recruit you. Some will try to control you. Some will try to stop you."

"Great. So everyone's going to be either worshipping me or trying to kill me?"

"Probably." Ren's attempt at humor fell flat. "But you won't be alone. The Apostles will protect you. Teach you. We've been preparing for this."

"How many Apostles are there?"

"Twelve. Some are reincarnated souls who walked with Yeshua before. Some are new—chosen for this iteration. I'm one of the old ones. I've been doing this for..." He trailed off. "A long time."

"And you've just been waiting. For me to wake up."

"For someone to wake up the right way. It happened to be you."

I walked to the window, looking out at Los Angeles. Millions of people going about their lives, completely unaware of this hidden world. This frequency that connected everything.

"When do I meet the others?" I asked.

"Soon. But first, we need to make sure you can actually control this. Last night was instinctual. Today, we practice intentionally."

I turned back to face him. "How?"

Ren smiled. "We start small. Feel that humming in your chest? The one that hasn't stopped since last night?"

I nodded. It was always there now, a constant vibration.

"That's your connection to Source. Right now it's like a radio stuck between stations—lots of noise, no clarity. We're going to teach you to tune it. To focus it. To direct it with precision instead of just spraying energy everywhere."

"And how do we do that?"

Ren walked over to his bookshelf and picked up a small potted plant—a succulent that looked half-dead.

"We start with something simple," he said, setting it on the coffee table between us. "This plant is dying. I've been neglecting it. Your first lesson is to give it life. Not force it to grow. Not control it. Just... share your energy with it. Let it choose what to do with what you give."

I stared at the sad little succulent. "You want me to... heal a plant?"

"I want you to connect with it. To understand that the frequency isn't just for people. It's for everything. All life. All matter. Everything is vibrating, Chris. You just need to learn to match that vibration."

I sat down across from the plant, feeling slightly ridiculous.

"Close your eyes," Ren instructed. "Feel that humming? Good. Now, instead of sending it outward randomly, imagine it as a golden thread. A connection between your heart and the plant's core. Don't push. Don't pull. Just... reach out."

I did what he said. Closed my eyes. Felt the humming. And slowly, carefully, I imagined that thread of light extending from my chest toward the dying succulent.

At first, nothing. Then—

*There.*

A faint pulse. Almost like a heartbeat, but slower. Weaker. The plant's life force, struggling.

"I feel it," I whispered.

"Good. Now just let your energy flow through the thread. Like you did with Rojas. Natural. Easy. Don't force it."

I let the golden light flow. Gentle. Steady.

The plant's pulse strengthened.

"Open your eyes," Ren said softly.

I did.

The succulent was greener. Not dramatically—it wasn't suddenly blooming or anything. But the leaves that had been brown and curled were now slightly fuller. More alive.

"Holy shit," I breathed.

"That's lesson one," Ren said. "You just learned that life responds to life. Energy responds to energy. The frequency isn't about power over things—it's about connection with things."

I stared at the plant, then at my hands, then at Ren.

"What's lesson two?"

"Lesson two," Ren said, standing, "is learning that you can't save everything. Some things are meant to end. Some energies aren't meant to be amplified. You need to learn discernment. Wisdom. When to give and when to let go."

"How do I learn that?"

"By failing." His smile was sad. "By trying to help someone who doesn't want help. By amplifying the wrong thing and seeing what happens. By making mistakes in a controlled environment before you make them in the real world."

"That sounds painful."

"It will be," Ren agreed. "But better painful here, with me, than painful out there where the Controllers are watching. Where the consequences are real."

He paused, his expression growing more serious.

"There's something else you need to know. Something I should have told you first, but..." He sighed. "Every time you use the frequency to intervene—to change an outcome, to amplify someone, to affect the world—there's a cost."

I felt a chill run through me. "What kind of cost?"

"Karmic return. The universe seeks balance, Chris. When you give energy, when you push outcomes in a certain direction, that energy has to come from somewhere. And eventually, it comes back to you."

"What do you mean 'comes back'?"

"It depends on the intervention. Sometimes it's small—exhaustion, a headache, bad luck for a few days. Sometimes it's proportional—you help someone win something, you might lose something of equal value. The universe doesn't do debts. It balances."

I thought about last night. The game. Rojas. Smith.

"What did I pay for Game 7?"

Ren's expression was sympathetic. "You'll find out. Maybe you already have and didn't notice. A fight with a friend? Money problems? Something breaking? Small misfortunes that seem random but aren't."

My mind raced back through the morning. I'd woken up to a text from my mom—my car had been towed overnight for street cleaning I'd forgotten about. $400. Then my work laptop wouldn't turn on, meaning I'd have to go into the office instead of working from home. And earlier, I'd dropped my phone getting out of the shower, spiderwebbing the screen.

"Three things went wrong this morning," I said slowly. "Car towed. Laptop died. Broke my phone screen."

"There it is." Ren didn't look surprised. "Two major interventions—Rojas and Smith—plus the attempt with Yamamoto. The universe balanced the books. It always does."

"So every time I use this, something bad happens to me?"

"Not bad, necessarily. Just... balancing. Think of it like physics. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. You pushed the universe in a direction it wasn't naturally going. It pushed back."

"That's insane. Why would anyone use this power if it costs them?"

"Because sometimes it's worth it," Ren said quietly. "Because sometimes the intervention matters more than the cost. Because some people—people like The Apostles—believe that accepting the karmic return is part of the service. We don't manipulate for personal gain. We guide, we help, and we accept the consequences."

I sat with that for a moment. The weight of it.

"What happens if someone uses it for selfish reasons? If they cheat, steal, hurt people?"

"The karmic return is... proportional. And merciless." Ren's voice went hard. "I've seen people destroy their own lives trying to use the frequency for personal gain. The universe doesn't care about your intentions when it balances. It only cares about the magnitude of the intervention."

"So the Controllers..."

"Accept massive karmic returns as the cost of shaping world events. Or they've found ways to... deflect it. Pass it on to others. That's part of why they're so dangerous. They've learned to make other people pay their karmic debts."

My stomach turned. "That's possible?"

"It shouldn't be. But yes. It's one of the dark arts of the frequency. And it's one of the things we'll need to teach you to defend against."

I looked at the succulent, now slightly healthier, and wondered what small price I'd just paid for that tiny miracle.

"So every time I do this," I said slowly, "I need to decide if it's worth the cost."

"Exactly." Ren nodded. "That's wisdom. That's discernment. That's what separates someone who can use the frequency from someone who *should* use it."

I took a breath. This was my life now. Training. Learning. Preparing for something I didn't fully understand yet.

And accepting that every miracle came with a price.

"Okay," I said. "What's next?"

Ren checked his watch. "Next, you go home. Process this. Let it sink in. Tomorrow, I introduce you to another Apostle. Someone who's going to teach you things I can't."

"Like what?"

"Like how to hide your presence. Right now, you're broadcasting your awakening like a beacon. Every sensitive in the city can feel it. The Controllers probably already know about you. We need to teach you how to cloak yourself before they make their move."

A chill ran down my spine. "What kind of move?"

"The kind where they try to recruit you. Or eliminate you. Depending on how threatened they feel."

"Great. So I have a target on my back."

"You've always had a target on your back, Chris. You just didn't know it." Ren put a hand on my shoulder. "But now you have us. The Apostles. We've kept people safe for centuries. We'll keep you safe too."

I wanted to believe him. Looking at his face—this person who'd been my friend, who'd been watching over me, who'd apparently been doing this for lifetimes—I wanted to trust that everything would be okay.

But I could feel it now, underneath everything. The humming. The frequency. And threaded through it, like discord in a symphony, something else.

People watching. Waiting. Assessing.

I'd woken up. And I wasn't the only one who knew it.

"Tomorrow then," I said.

"Tomorrow," Ren agreed. "For now, go home. Rest. And Chris?"

"Yeah?"

"Don't try to use it again today. I know the temptation is there. But you need to let your system settle. Think of it like working out a muscle you didn't know you had. If you overtrain on day one, you'll hurt yourself."

I nodded and headed for the door. But before I left, I turned back.

"Ren. Whoever you are. Thank you. For being my friend. For waiting. For... all of it."

He smiled, and for a moment, I saw something ancient and deep in his eyes.

"Thank you for waking up, Chris. We've been waiting a long time for you."

I left his apartment and walked out into the Los Angeles sunlight, feeling the frequency hum beneath my skin, knowing that nothing would ever be the same again.

# CHAPTER THREE: THE CLOAK

I didn't sleep that night.

Every time I closed my eyes, I felt it—the frequency, humming beneath everything. The city's heartbeat. Millions of lives pulsing in rhythm, a symphony of consciousness I'd never noticed before. It was beautiful and overwhelming and I couldn't turn it off.

Around 3 AM, my neighbor's dog started barking. I could *feel* its distress through the wall. Anxiety. Fear of something I couldn't see. Without thinking, I reached out, sent a thread of golden light toward it, calming it.

The barking stopped.

Two minutes later, I dropped my glass of water. It shattered across the kitchen floor.

*Karmic return.*

I cleaned it up, hands trembling—not from fear this time, but from the realization of what my life had become. I couldn't even quiet a dog without the universe demanding payment.

By the time dawn broke, I'd decided to call in sick to work. There was no way I could sit in a cubicle and pretend to care about password resets and network issues when I could literally feel the electromagnetic pulse of every device in the building.

My phone buzzed at 7 AM. Ren.

**REN:** You awake?

**ME:** Never went to sleep.

**REN:** Good. That means you're ready. Meet me at Griffith Park, the Observatory parking lot. 8 AM. Someone wants to meet you.

**ME:** Another Apostle?

**REN:** The one who's going to teach you how to hide.

---

Griffith Observatory sits on the southern slope of Mount Hollywood, overlooking the entire Los Angeles basin. On a clear morning like this, you could see from downtown to the ocean, the whole sprawling city laid out like a circuit board.

I found Ren standing near the edge of the parking lot, looking out over the view. Next to him was a woman I'd never seen before—late fifties maybe, with silver-streaked black hair pulled into a loose bun. She wore simple clothes, jeans and a linen shirt, but there was something about her presence that made the air feel different. Heavier. More intentional.

"Chris," Ren said as I approached. "This is Miriam."

The woman turned to face me, and I felt it immediately—a void where there should have been presence. Like looking at a hole in reality. I could see her, but the frequency couldn't find her. She was... absent.

"You're broadcasting," she said without preamble. Her voice was warm but matter-of-fact. "Like a lighthouse in a storm. Every sensitive within fifty miles can feel you. That's dangerous."

"Ren mentioned that," I said. "How do I stop?"

"You don't stop. You learn to modulate. To blend." She gestured to the view. "Look at the city. Millions of people, all vibrating at different frequencies. Some loud, some quiet. You need to learn to match the background noise. To become one voice in the choir instead of a soloist."

I looked out at Los Angeles, trying to feel what she was describing. The frequency showed me layers—a constant hum of collective consciousness, punctuated by brighter sparks. People in flow states. Moments of intense emotion. The natural rhythm of a city waking up.

"I don't understand how to do that," I admitted.

"Because you're trying to hide your light," Miriam said. "That's the wrong approach. Light can't hide. But it can diffuse. It can spread out so evenly that it becomes invisible. Watch."

She closed her eyes. And suddenly—nothing. The void I'd felt around her expanded, but not in an empty way. It was more like she'd become *everywhere* instead of somewhere specific. Her presence was still there, but it was distributed across the entire landscape, impossible to pinpoint.

Then she opened her eyes and snapped back into focus. The void collapsed back into her body.

"How?" I breathed.

"By letting go of the idea that you are separate from everything else." She smiled gently. "You're holding onto yourself too tightly, Chris. Your ego, your identity, your sense of 'I am here and everything else is there.' That's what makes you visible. You're a knot in the fabric. To hide, you need to untie yourself."

"That sounds like dying."

"It's the opposite. It's remembering that you were never separate in the first place." She gestured to a bench. "Sit. We're going to practice."

I sat, but something twisted in my chest. Watching her disappear like that—effortless, complete, like she'd done it a thousand times—made me feel small. Inadequate. She'd probably been doing this for lifetimes. Ren could fold space without thinking. The Apostles moved through reality like water.

And I could barely quiet a dog without breaking a glass.

"You're comparing," Miriam said softly, reading something in my expression.

"Of course I am. You just... you made it look so easy. And I can't even—" I gestured vaguely at myself. "I'm so far behind."

She sat beside me, her presence warm despite the void I'd felt moments before. "Chris, what you admire in me—that ease, that mastery—where do you think it exists?"

"In you. You've been practicing for—"

"It exists in the frequency itself. In the potential of consciousness. And what is consciousness?"

I thought about what Ren had taught me. "Universal. One thing experiencing itself as many."

"Exactly. So if I can dissolve into everything, and consciousness is universal, then..." She waited.

"Then I can too," I finished, but it felt hollow. Theoretical.

"Not someday. Right now. This moment." She placed a hand on my chest. "The same awareness that flows through me flows through you. The same Source. The difference isn't capacity—it's practice. And even that gap isn't what you think."

"What do you mean?"

"You're not seeing potential in yourself that you admire in me. You're seeing it in me because you're denying it in yourself. I'm a mirror, Chris. Every ability that impresses you, every skill that makes you feel less than—that's showing you what you haven't activated yet. Not what you can never have."

The twist in my chest loosened slightly. "So I'm... envious?"

"Energy," she corrected. "You're feeling energy that wants to move you toward your own development. But your mind labeled it 'envy' and turned it against yourself. Watch what happens when you shift the frequency."

She was quiet for a moment, letting me feel it. The comparison. The inadequacy. The hunger to be as skilled as she was.

"Feel that fully," she said. "Don't judge it. Don't suppress it. Just... what's underneath? What's that feeling actually trying to tell you?"

I closed my eyes, let myself really feel it. And under the comparison, under the not-enough-ness, I found something else.

Hope.

If she could do it, the potential existed. Not in some abstract universe, but in actual human consciousness. Someone had walked this path before. Left footprints.

"Oh," I whispered.

"There it is." Miriam smiled. "Your envy just became aspiration. Same energy. Different frequency. You're not less than me, Chris. You're earlier in the process. And that's actually a gift—you remember what it's like to struggle. When you teach others someday, you'll remember this moment."

"When I teach others?"

"Of course. You think you're learning this just for yourself?" She laughed. "You're going to help millions of people remember they're connected. They'll look at you the way you're looking at me right now. Feeling inadequate. Comparing. And you'll remember this moment and tell them what I'm telling you: We're all the same Source, just at different points in remembering."

The feeling in my chest transformed completely. Still intense, still powerful—but now it felt like fuel. Like possibility.

"Thank you," I said.

"Don't thank me. Thank yourself for being willing to feel it and let it transform." She stood. "Now, let's see if you can dissolve. Not like me—like you. Your way. Your pace."

I sat. Ren took a position nearby, watching.

"Close your eyes," Miriam instructed.

I did. Felt the frequency spreading.

"Now, instead of pushing your awareness outward, let it dissolve. Imagine your boundaries are just suggestions. Let your edges blur. Let yourself seep into everything around you. Don't force it. Just... allow it."

I tried. Every time I started to dissolve, panic spiked and I'd snap back.

"You're afraid," Miriam observed.

"Of what?"

"Of disappearing. Of losing yourself. It's valid. Some people do get lost. But that won't happen today, because Ren and I are here to anchor you. Trust us. Let go."

I took a breath. Then stopped trying to control it and just... released.

The boundaries blurred.

My awareness spread like water spilling. I was in the bench, the ground, the air. I was in the trees, the tourists arriving. I was everywhere and nowhere.

And then I felt—other presences. Distinct points. Three of them.

One was Ren. One was Miriam.

The third was wrong. Cold. Calculating. Like being studied by a predator.

I snapped back, gasping.

"You felt them," Miriam said.

"Three. But the third wasn't friendly."

Ren's expression darkened. "How far?"

Miriam's awareness spread. "Close. Quarter mile. They're not hiding."

"A Controller," Ren said. "Found you faster than expected."

Miriam's presence expanded defensively, shielding us. "They won't pinpoint him now. But Chris, you need to learn this fast."

The rest of the day: Dissolving practice. Controllers watching. My phone buzzing with texts from V—offers, questions, temptations. I blocked every number. Practiced what Miriam taught—spreading thin, becoming invisible.

That cold presence tried to follow. Couldn't pinpoint me anymore.

I was learning to hide.

But more importantly, learning why I needed to.
