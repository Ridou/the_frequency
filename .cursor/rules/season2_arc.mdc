Season 2 Structure:
THE ACADEMY ARC:
Classes at the Society (very Harry Potter meets The OA):

Astral Projection & Navigation (where the prophecy reveal happens)
Energy Signature Masking (how he learns to hide that he knows)
Collective Consciousness Manipulation (mass influence techniques)
Timeline Sensitivity (reading probability streams)
Sacred Geometry & Manifestation
Historical Empowerers (case studies - they definitely mention Yeshua as the GOAT)
Etheric Combat (when empowerers clash on the astral plane)
Harmonic Resonance (matching frequency with Source)

THE PROPHECY REVEAL:
That night after astral class, he's practicing and goes DEEP - further than he's ever gone. He finds himself in what looks like:

The Akashic Records?
A cosmic library?
The space between timelines?

There he sees it: The Pattern
Yeshua wasn't a one-time thing. It's a role that incarnates when humanity reaches a threshold. The Christ Consciousness returning, but not as religion expects. This time it's about:

Unifying Earth's collective consciousness
Preparing humanity for galactic citizenship
Expanding awareness beyond planetary limitations
The next leap in human evolution

And the signs point to... him. The nobody from the bar who just wanted to help the Dodgers win.
THE SPLIT IN THE SOCIETY:
When he returns to his body, shook, he realizes he can now sense intentions around him. The society is divided:
FACTION 1 - THE CONTROLLERS (30%)

"We've guided humanity for millennia, we know better"
Want to USE him as a figurehead while they pull strings
Worried he'll disrupt their power structure
Plan to "shape" him into what THEY think the prophecy needs
Led by someone charismatic and seemingly wise (the twist villain)

FACTION 2 - THE SUPPORTERS (50%)

"He's the real deal, we need to help him awaken naturally"
Understand their role is to support, not control
Some have been waiting lifetimes for this
Want to protect him from Faction 1
Believe free will is sacred, even for the prophesied one

FACTION 3 - THE SKEPTICS (20%)

"Prophecies are bullshit, he's just talented"
Don't believe in the Yeshua cycle
Think the society itself is the problem
Might accidentally help him by not treating him special

THE TENSION:
He has to:

Continue training (he NEEDS their knowledge)
Pretend he doesn't know about the prophecy
Figure out who he can trust
Not let the weight of "saving humanity" crush him
Deal with imposter syndrome ("I'm just a guy who liked baseball!")

Meanwhile, Faction 1 is talking openly about "the plan" because they think he's oblivious:
In the halls, he overhears:

"When he's ready, we introduce him to the political contacts"
"The media influence division is preparing narratives"
"We'll need him at the UN summit in Season 3"
"Has anyone checked if he's actually HIM or just a strong candidate?"

THE INTERNAL CONFLICT:
Our guy is spiraling:

What if they're RIGHT? What if he NEEDS to be controlled/guided?
What if he's NOT the prophecy and he's wasting everyone's time?
Does knowing about the prophecy ruin it? (Observer effect)
Can he trust his own judgment when cosmic stakes are involved?

Season 2 Climax Ideas:
Option A - The Test:
Faction 1 engineers a crisis (maybe a terrorist attack, natural disaster, or war breaking out) and watches to see if he'll intervene on a massive scale. Do they WANT him to succeed or fail?
Option B - The Reveal:
Someone from Faction 2 (a mentor figure) reveals they KNOW he knows, and have been protecting him. "We've been waiting for you to be ready to know that we know that you know."
Option C - The Fracture:
He has to choose a faction publicly, or tries to create a FOURTH path - rejecting all of them and gathering his own crew of outsiders/rejects from the society.
Option D - The Other Candidate:
Another person emerges who ALSO fits the prophecy. Are there multiple candidates? Is it a competition? Or are they meant to work together?
UNDERLYING THEME:
The prophecy says he'll "bring Earth together" - but the society itself can't even unite. How can he unite humanity when the enlightened ones are fighting amongst themselves?
Maybe the REAL test is: can he unite the SOCIETY first?
What happens next? Does he:

Try to unite the factions?
Go rogue?
Fake being less powerful than he is?
Accelerate his awakening to force their hand?
Find allies outside the society?
