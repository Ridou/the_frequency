## Complete Guide to Publishing THE FREQUENCY on Amazon

---

## 📋 PRE-PUBLISHING REQUIREMENTS

### ✅ MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION

- [x] **Complete manuscript** - 32,948 words (Prologue + 12 chapters)
- [ ] **Professional editing** - CRITICAL (see below)
- [ ] **Final proofread** - Catch remaining typos/errors
- [ ] **Format for eBook** - .epub or .mobi compatible
- [ ] **Format for Print** - PDF with proper margins/formatting

- [ ] **Dedication page** (optional)
- [ ] **Acknowledgments** (optional)
- [ ] **Table of Contents** - Linked for eBook navigation

**⚠️ WORD COUNT NOTE:**
Your current manuscript is 32,948 words. This is considered a **novella** (30K-50K words) rather than a full novel (70K-100K for adult fiction). 

**Options:**
1. **Market as novella** - Price lower ($2.99-3.99), shorter read
2. **Expand to novel length** - Add 35K-40K more words to reach 70K minimum
3. **Market as "Book One"** - Series starter, acceptable to be shorter

**Recommendation:** Since this is Book One of a trilogy, you can publish as-is BUT consider adding 15-20K words to reach ~50K (solid novella length) for better pricing flexibility.
