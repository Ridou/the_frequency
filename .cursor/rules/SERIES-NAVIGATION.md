## 🎯 HOW TO USE THIS STRUCTURE

### **Working on Book One:**
→ `book-one/chapters/` (all chapters there)  
→ `book-one/notes/` (development log)  
→ `.cursor/rules/Manuscript.mdc` (complete text)

### **Planning Book Two:**
→ `.cursor/rules/book2.mdc` (OPTIONS + AUTHOR VOTES)  
→ `book-two/outlines/book-two-structure.md` (CONSENSUS PLAN)  
→ `shared/series-bible/THE-FREQUENCY-BIBLE.md` (continuity check)

### **Writing Book Two:**
→ `book-two/chapters/` (write new chapters here)  
→ `book-two/notes/` (development notes)  
→ Check `shared/` for character consistency

### **Need Series Info:**
→ `shared/series-bible/THE-FREQUENCY-BIBLE.md` (MASTER REFERENCE)  
→ `shared/characters/` (all character profiles)  
→ `shared/world-building/` (magic system, locations, themes)

## 💡 BEST PRACTICES

### **When Writing Any Book:**

**ALWAYS CHECK:**
1. **Series Bible** first (consistency!)
2. **Character files** (voices, traits)
3. **Magic system** (don't violate rules)
4. **Timeline** (events in order)

**NEVER:**
- Contradict established magic rules
- Change character fundamentals
- Violate core themes
- Forget karmic return mechanics

**UPDATE:**
- Series bible when major things change
- Character files with new development
- Feedback files with reader responses
