## 🎯 QUICK START: GETTING PUBLISHED

### ⭐ **RECOMMENDED: Amazon KDP (Self-Publishing)**

**Why this is the best path for you:**
- Book One complete, Book Two already drafted
- You control timeline and pricing
- Build audience for trilogy
- Higher royalty rates (70% vs 10-15% traditional)
- Faster to market (3-6 months vs 2+ years)
- Can always go traditional later with proven sales

**Complete Step-by-Step Guide:** See `AMAZON-KDP-CHECKLIST.md`

**Quick Path:**
1. Expand manuscript to 50K words (optional but recommended)
2. Professional editing ($800-1,500)
3. Cover design using AI + refinement ($300-800) - See `COVER-ART-PROMPT.md`
4. Format for Kindle and Print ($0-$250)
5. Upload to Amazon KDP
6. Launch with review campaign
7. Build audience for Book Two

**Expected Investment:** $1,500-3,000  
**Expected Timeline:** 3-4 months to launch  
**Expected Revenue Year One:** $5K-$20K+ (if marketed well)  

---

### Option 2: Traditional Publishing

**Step 1:** Expand manuscript to 70K+ words (required for traditional)  
**Step 2:** Research agents who rep consciousness/sci-fi  
**Step 3:** Personalize query letter template  
**Step 4:** Submit to 10-15 agents  
**Step 5:** Wait 6-12 weeks for responses  

**Expected Advance:** $25K-$75K for trilogy  
**Timeline:** 1-2 years to publication  
**Benefits:** Distribution, marketing support, credibility  
**Challenges:** Very competitive, slow process, less control

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

**Step 1:** Self-publish Book One on Amazon  
**Step 2:** Build sales to 10K+ copies  
**Step 3:** Use numbers to attract traditional publisher  
**Step 4:** Sell Books 2 & 3 as series with proven audience  

**Best of both worlds:** Prove the market exists, then scale with publisher support.
