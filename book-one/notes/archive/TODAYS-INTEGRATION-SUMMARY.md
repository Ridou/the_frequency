## 📊 SUPER BOWL TIMELINE (FINAL CORRECT VERSION)

### **The Actual Facts:**

- **Super Bowl LVIII (2024):** Usher performed, Chiefs vs 49ers
- **Super Bowl LIX (2025):** **KENDRICK LAMAR performed** with SZA in New Orleans
  - **Teams:** Philadelphia Eagles vs Kansas City Chiefs
  - **Result:** **Eagles WON 40-22** (dominated)
  - **Halftime:** Kendrick + SZA + Samuel L. Jackson + Serena Williams
  - **Taylor:** Watched Travis LOSE (heartbreak, not joy)
- **Super Bowl LX (2026):** Bad Bunny will perform (upcoming)

### **Sophia's Awakening (Now 100% Accurate):**

**Event:** Super Bowl LIX - February 9, 2025, New Orleans  
**Halftime:** Kendrick Lamar and SZA ("Not Like Us")  
**Game:** Eagles destroyed Chiefs 40-22  
**Taylor's Experience:** Supporting Travis through LOSS (24-0 at halftime, never recovered)

**Sophia Felt:**
- Eagles fans: ECSTATIC JOY (their team won!)
