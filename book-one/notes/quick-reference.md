## Core Themes

1. **Unity vs. Separation** - Are we one or many?
2. **Control vs. Freedom** - Force or amplify?
3. **Transformation Without Destruction** - Can we evolve without dying?
4. **Individual vs. Collective** - Shared burden = no burden
5. **Speed vs. Sustainability** - Fast but dangerous vs. slow but safe
6. **Cost and Consequence** - Karmic return for all except love

## Key Rules

### Magic System
- Name + visual lock for connection
- Golden light = frequency
- Amplify, don't control = Apostle way
- Force outcomes = Controller way
- Karmic return always balances

### Folding
- "I'm already there" (absolute knowing)
- Leave anchors to find way back
- Can get lost/fragmented
- Easier at certain times/places

### Cloaking
- Dissolve into everything
- Let go of ego/boundaries
- Must remember how to return
- Becomes invisible in frequency
