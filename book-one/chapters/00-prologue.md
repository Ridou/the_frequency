# PROLOGUE

They say God doesn't watch baseball.

I used to believe that. Used to think the divine had better things to do than care about whether a ball cleared a fence or died in a glove. Used to think miracles were reserved for the sick, the dying, the desperate—not for millionaires chasing a championship in the eleventh inning of Game 7.

I was wrong about a lot of things.

The night I learned this, I was four beers deep at McHenry's on Sunset, watching the greatest World Series game I'd ever seen slowly kill me. The Dodgers were down 4-3 in the top of the ninth, two outs, and I was watching history slip away. My buddy Ren was next to me, unusually quiet for once, both of us locked into that helpless feeling you get when you care too much about something you can't control.

"This is it," Ren said softly. "Miguel Rojas is up. If anyone's gonna—"

He didn't finish. Didn't need to.

I knew Rojas. Utility infielder. Not a home run hitter. Against a righty like Jeff Hoffman? The odds were astronomical. But something in me stirred as I watched him step into the box. Not at the situation—at *him*. The way he carried himself. Like he knew something nobody else did.

"He's got this," I said, surprising myself.

Ren glanced at me. "Chris, man, I love the optimism, but—"

"No. Watch."

I couldn't explain it, but something had shifted in the air—or maybe in me. The bar noise faded to a dull hum. The TV screen seemed to brighten, pulling my vision forward until Miguel Rojas was all I could see. His name floated beneath his image on the broadcast: **ROJAS**.

I said it out loud, barely a whisper. "Miguel Rojas."

The world... *responded*.

I can't describe it better than that. It was like saying his name opened a door, and on the other side was a web of light—fractal, infinite, alive. I could see it with my eyes closed. Could feel it humming through my chest, spreading down my arms. And somewhere at the other end of that web, standing in a batter's box in Toronto, was Miguel Rojas.

I saw him. Not on the TV—*saw* him. The way you see something in a dream that feels more real than waking. Every detail: the pine tar on his bat, the way his fingers gripped the handle, the absolute certainty in his eyes.

And I felt him. Not doubt this time. *Belief*. Pure, unshakeable belief.

Without thinking—without even knowing what I was doing—I reached out.

Not with my hands. With something else. Something that had always been there but I'd never known how to use. It felt like breathing, if breathing could cross distance and intention could become tangible. I imagined light—gold and warm—pouring from somewhere above me, through me, into him. Down through his crown, into his arms, his core, his legs.

I didn't tell him what to do. I just... amplified him. Made him more of what he already was.

"Full count," the announcer said. "Hoffman winds..."

The slider hung. Just for a fraction of a second. Just enough.

Rojas crushed it.

The crack of the bat was so clean it cut through the bar noise like a bell. The ball sailed—arcing, perfect, impossible—and cleared the left field fence. 

Game tied. Extra innings.

McHenry's exploded. Ren was on his feet, beer going everywhere, grabbing my shoulders and shaking me. "HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT, DID YOU SEE THAT?!"

But I could barely register his excitement. Everything felt surreal—like I was watching the celebration through a veil. The bar noise was distant, muffled. All I could feel was that humming in my chest, stronger now, still vibrating from the connection I'd just made.

I knew—*knew*—what I'd just done.

I'd touched something I wasn't supposed to touch.

And it had touched me back.

---

The game didn't end there.

Of course it didn't. This was Game 7. This was the World Series. This was the kind of moment that gets replayed for generations.

The eleventh inning. Will Smith at the plate. Shane Bieber on the mound for Toronto, running on fumes and prayers.

I did it again.

I know I shouldn't have. I know the ethical implications were already spiraling in the back of my mind. But watching Smith step into that box, knowing he'd caught every single inning of this series, knowing he was exhausted but *there*—I couldn't help myself.

"Will Smith," I whispered, and the web opened.

Golden light. Through me, into him. Not controlling. Just... *amplifying*. Making him more of what he already was.

The 2-0 slider hung. Smith didn't miss.

The ball disappeared into the left field stands, and McHenry's lost its collective mind. Ren was hugging strangers. I was frozen, watching the replay, watching Smith round the bases, and all I could think was:

*I'm doing this. I'm actually doing this.*

But then the bottom of the eleventh happened, and I learned something important: some people don't want—or need—my help.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto—who'd thrown 96 pitches the night before, who'd already pitched in this game—was back on the mound. The man was running on fumes and sheer will. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. doubled. The tying run was on third.

I couldn't help myself. I reached out, sent that golden light toward Yamamoto, tried to give him energy, strength.

The connection formed. I felt him—his exhaustion, yes, but also his absolute conviction. His pride. His—

His next pitch sailed high and inside, nearly hitting Kiner-Falefa. The umpire stepped out, concerned.

And then I *felt* it. Not words exactly, but a presence. A response through the frequency, sharp and clear:

*I don't need it.*

Yamamoto's will pushed back against mine—not angry, but firm. Stoic. Like a master craftsman politely declining help from an apprentice.

*Watch me.*

The message was crystal clear, accompanied by a feeling of quiet confidence that bordered on defiance. Not arrogance—this was different. This was a man who'd spent his entire life perfecting his craft, who'd come back on one day's rest to close out a World Series, who knew *exactly* what he was capable of.

*Let me show you how good I am.*

I pulled back immediately, feeling like I'd just insulted a samurai by offering him a beginner's sword. Respect flooded through me—this wasn't someone who needed amplification. This was someone who was already operating at a level I couldn't comprehend.

Out of respect, I just watched. Really watched. The way he commanded his body despite exhaustion. The way each pitch was deliberate, chosen, *his*. 

Yamamoto induced a sacrifice bunt—perfect execution. Then walked the next batter on four straight splitters—exactly as intended, setting up the double play. Bases loaded. Alejandro Kirk at the plate.

0-2 count. 

The splitter dove. Kirk swung. Ground ball to short.

Double play. Game over.

As Yamamoto's teammates mobbed him on the mound, I could still feel the echo of his presence. That quiet pride. That absolute mastery.

I'd just learned my first real lesson about the frequency: some people are already full. And trying to add more just gets in their way.

The Dodgers were back-to-back champions.

And I was... what? A guy at a bar who could channel energy into baseball players? A cosmic cheat code? A violation of free will wrapped in good intentions?

"CHRIS!" Ren grabbed me, shaking me out of my spiral. "We just watched the greatest Game 7 in history! Say something!"

I looked at him. Really looked at him. Ren had been my friend for three years. We met at a coffee shop, bonded over our mutual love of baseball and philosophy and bad sci-fi movies. He was the kind of guy who always seemed to know more than he let on, who asked questions that made you think about things differently.

And right now, he was looking at me with an expression I couldn't quite read.

"Yeah," I said slowly. "Greatest game ever."

He held my gaze for a moment longer than necessary. Then he smiled, clapped me on the shoulder, and turned back to the celebration.

But I'd seen it. Just for a second. Recognition.

*He knows.*
