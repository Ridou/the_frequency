# CHAPTER ONE: THE FREQUENCY

The hangover should've been worse.

Five beers, three shots of whiskey, and a plate of wings that probably violated several health codes—I should've woken up feeling like death. Instead, I felt... electric. Wired. Like I'd mainlined lightning directly into my nervous system.

I lay in my apartment as morning light cut through the blinds, staring at the ceiling, replaying every moment.

Rojas in the ninth. That impossible, beautiful swing.

Smith in the eleventh. The way the ball just *knew* it was gone.

And Yamamoto. The way my energy couldn't touch him. The way he was already operating at a level I couldn't comprehend.

*I made some of that happen.*

No. That was insane. Correlation, not causation. Confirmation bias. Magical thinking. All the rational explanations lined up like good soldiers, ready to march me back to normalcy.

Except I could still feel it. The web of light. The connection. It hummed in my chest like a struck tuning fork that refused to fade.

My phone buzzed. Ren.

**REN:** You sleep at all?

**ME:** Not really. You?

**REN:** Nah. Coffee? Usual spot?

I stared at the message. The usual spot. The coffee shop where we'd met. Where Ren always seemed to appear exactly when I needed to talk about something that mattered.

*He knows.*

Or maybe I was paranoid. Maybe I was losing it. Maybe I'd just watched too much baseball and my brain was making connections that didn't exist.

**ME:** Give me 30

**REN:** Take your time. We should talk.

My stomach flipped.

*We should talk.*

Those three words could mean anything. Could mean nothing. Could mean everything.

I got up, showered, tried to convince myself I wasn't about to have the weirdest conversation of my life.

I was wrong about that, too.

---

The coffee shop was called Frequency—which, in retrospect, should've been my first clue that the universe had a sense of humor about all this.

Ren was already there, sitting at our usual table by the window, two cups of coffee waiting. He looked tired but wired, the same way I felt. Like neither of us had processed what we'd witnessed yet.

"Greatest game of all time," he said as I sat down. "No question."

"Yeah." I took a sip of coffee. "That Rojas homer. I mean, what are the odds?"

"Astronomical." Ren's eyes locked onto mine. "Almost impossible, really. A utility infielder who'd hit one home run off a righty all season—and that was against a position player. Against one of the best closers in baseball, in the biggest moment imaginable?"

I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

"Unless," Ren continued, voice casual but eyes intense, "he had help."

The coffee shop noise faded. That humming in my chest—the frequency—suddenly felt like a siren.

"What do you mean?" My voice came out steadier than I felt.

Ren smiled. It wasn't his usual grin. This was something else. Something older.

"Chris. My friend. My brother." He leaned forward. "I know what you did last night."

The world tilted.

"I don't—"

"Yes, you do." He wasn't accusing. He was... relieved? "You felt it. The connection. The light. You reached out and you helped him. You gave him energy, strength, *presence*. You amplified what was already there."

I couldn't breathe.

"How—"

"Because," Ren said quietly, "I've been waiting three years for you to wake up."

The coffee shop sounds came rushing back all at once. The hiss of the espresso machine. Someone's laugh. A chair scraping. All of it too loud, too sharp, too *real* for this conversation to be happening.

"Three years," I repeated slowly. "You've been... what? Watching me?"

"Guiding you." Ren's expression was gentle but serious. "Chris, we didn't meet by accident. I was sent to find you. To be your friend—and that part wasn't fake, by the way. The friendship is real. But I was also sent to observe. To wait. To see if you would awaken naturally."

I stood up. Sat back down. Stood up again.

"Sent by who? What the hell are you talking about? Are you—is this some kind of—"

"Breathe," Ren said. "I know this is a lot. But you need to hear it, because what happened last night changes everything."

I forced myself to sit. To breathe. To listen.

"There's a group," Ren began. "We call it the Society. People like us—people who can connect to what you experienced last night. We call it Source. The frequency. The web. Different names for the same thing. It's always been there. Some spiritual traditions call it universal consciousness. Some scientists would call it quantum entanglement. Some people just call it love."

"And you... you're part of this Society?"

"I'm part of something deeper. A smaller group within the Society. We call ourselves The Apostles." He paused, watching my reaction. "We've been around a long time, Chris. Reincarnating, waiting, watching. We look for people like you."

"People like me," I said flatly. "What does that even mean?"

"People who have the potential to do what you did last night. But more importantly—people who would do it the *right way*."

That stopped me. "The right way?"

Ren leaned forward, his voice dropping. "Last night was a test, Chris. We've known about your potential for years. I've been waiting for the moment you'd finally access it. And when you did—when you reached out to Rojas, to Smith—I was watching to see *how* you'd do it."

My hands clenched around my coffee cup. "You were... testing me? While I was having some kind of cosmic breakthrough, you were *grading me*?"

"Not grading. Observing." He held up a hand before I could explode. "Listen to me. This matters. There are people in the Society who use this ability to control others. To manipulate outcomes for their own gain. They reach into someone's mind and *force* them to do what they want. It's a violation. A corruption of what Source is meant to be."

I thought about that moment with Rojas. The golden light. The amplification.

"I didn't make him hit that home run," I said slowly. "I just... gave him energy. He still had to swing. He still had to connect."

"Exactly." Ren's smile was genuine now, proud even. "You amplified what was already there. You respected his free will. You gave him strength but let him make the choice. That's the difference, Chris. That's why I've been waiting three years to have this conversation."

"And if I'd done it differently?"

His expression darkened. "Then I would've had to stop you. Guide you away from ever doing it again. Or worse—report you to the Society, and they would've... handled it."

The implications of that hung in the air.

"So what now?" I asked. "You're going to take me to this Society? Introduce me to your Apostle friends? Teach me to use this... this frequency?"

"If you want." Ren's voice was carefully neutral. "No one will force you, Chris. That's not how this works. But I will tell you this: you've awakened. There's no putting that genie back in the bottle. You'll keep feeling it, keep sensing the connections. And if you don't learn to control it, to understand it, it will control you."

I thought about the humming in my chest. The way it hadn't stopped since last night.

"And if I say yes? What happens?"

"First, I tell you my real name." He smiled wryly. "Ren Jaldoa Manzanarez. You can keep calling me Ren—most people do. Second, I introduce you to The Apostles. We'll explain everything: the history, the prophecy, what we believe is happening in the world right now. And third..." He paused. "Third, we begin your training. Because Chris, what you did last night? That was instinct. Raw, untrained, beautiful instinct. But imagine what you could do if you actually knew what you were doing."

I stared at him. At Ren. At this person who'd been my friend for three years, who I'd trusted with my weirdest thoughts and my worst jokes, who'd apparently been an immortal soul-guide the whole time.

"This is insane," I said.

"Yes."

"This is absolutely batshit insane."

"Also yes."

"And you're telling me that there are others? That this is real? That I'm not losing my mind?"

"You're not losing your mind. You're finding it. Your real mind. The one that's always been connected to everything else."

I looked down at my hands. Ordinary hands. Hands that had apparently channeled cosmic energy into professional baseball players twelve hours ago.

"Can I ask you something?"

"Anything."

"When you watched Yamamoto pitch last night—in the eleventh, when he came back out on no rest—did you feel it? The way he... talked back to me?"

Ren's eyes widened. "He *communicated* with you? Through the frequency?"

"Yeah. I tried to help him and he basically told me to back off. Not mean, just... confident. Like 'watch me, I got this.' And then he proved it."

Ren leaned back, looking impressed. "Chris, that's rare. Most people who operate at the frequency don't even know they're doing it. Yamamoto clearly has some level of conscious awareness. He felt you reaching out and responded. That's... that's actually incredible for both of you."

"I almost ruined his control. My energy made his pitch go wild."

"Because you were adding to something that was already perfect. Like trying to tune a guitar that's already in tune—you just make it worse." Ren's expression turned serious. "That's an important lesson. Some people are already aligned with Source. They don't need amplification. They need space to do what they do best."

"He was so... present. So absolutely there."

"That's what mastery looks like," Ren said softly. "When someone has dedicated their entire life to perfecting their craft, when they're in complete harmony with their purpose—they're already operating at peak frequency. Your job isn't to make them better. It's to recognize them and get out of their way."

"Is that what I'm going to learn? How to be like that all the time?"

"That's what we're going to teach you. If you want."

I sat there for a long moment, watching the morning light filter through the window, watching ordinary people live their ordinary lives, completely unaware that there was this whole other layer of reality humming beneath everything.

"Okay," I said finally. "Okay. I'm in. Teach me."

Ren's smile could've lit up the whole room.

"Welcome to the frequency, Christian Rand. Your life just got a lot more interesting."

"It was already pretty interesting."

"Trust me," Ren said, standing and dropping cash on the table. "You have no idea."
