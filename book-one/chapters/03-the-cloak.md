# CHAPTER THREE: THE CLOAK

I didn't sleep that night.

Every time I closed my eyes, I felt it—the frequency, humming beneath everything. The city's heartbeat. Millions of lives pulsing in rhythm, a symphony of consciousness I'd never noticed before. It was beautiful and overwhelming and I couldn't turn it off.

Around 3 AM, my neighbor's dog started barking. I could *feel* its distress through the wall. Anxiety. Fear of something I couldn't see. Without thinking, I reached out, sent a thread of golden light toward it, calming it.

The barking stopped.

Two minutes later, I dropped my glass of water. It shattered across the kitchen floor.

*Karmic return.*

I cleaned it up, hands trembling—not from fear this time, but from the realization of what my life had become. I couldn't even quiet a dog without the universe demanding payment.

By the time dawn broke, I'd decided to call in sick to work. There was no way I could sit in a cubicle and pretend to care about password resets and network issues when I could literally feel the electromagnetic pulse of every device in the building.

My phone buzzed at 7 AM. Ren.

**REN:** You awake?

**ME:** Never went to sleep.

**REN:** Good. That means you're ready. Meet me at Griffith Park, the Observatory parking lot. 8 AM. Someone wants to meet you.

**ME:** Another Apostle?

**REN:** The one who's going to teach you how to hide.

---

Griffith Observatory sits on the southern slope of Mount Hollywood, overlooking the entire Los Angeles basin. On a clear morning like this, you could see from downtown to the ocean, the whole sprawling city laid out like a circuit board.

I found Ren standing near the edge of the parking lot, looking out over the view. Next to him was a woman I'd never seen before—late fifties maybe, with silver-streaked black hair pulled into a loose bun. She wore simple clothes, jeans and a linen shirt, but there was something about her presence that made the air feel different. Heavier. More intentional.

"Chris," Ren said as I approached. "This is Miriam."

The woman turned to face me, and I felt it immediately—a void where there should have been presence. Like looking at a hole in reality. I could see her, but the frequency couldn't find her. She was... absent.

"You're broadcasting," she said without preamble. Her voice was warm but matter-of-fact. "Like a lighthouse in a storm. Every sensitive within fifty miles can feel you. That's dangerous."

"Ren mentioned that," I said. "How do I stop?"

"You don't stop. You learn to modulate. To blend." She gestured to the view. "Look at the city. Millions of people, all vibrating at different frequencies. Some loud, some quiet. You need to learn to match the background noise. To become one voice in the choir instead of a soloist."

I looked out at Los Angeles, trying to feel what she was describing. The frequency showed me layers—a constant hum of collective consciousness, punctuated by brighter sparks. People in flow states. Moments of intense emotion. The natural rhythm of a city waking up.

"I don't understand how to do that," I admitted.

"Because you're trying to hide your light," Miriam said. "That's the wrong approach. Light can't hide. But it can diffuse. It can spread out so evenly that it becomes invisible. Watch."

She closed her eyes. And suddenly—nothing. The void I'd felt around her expanded, but not in an empty way. It was more like she'd become *everywhere* instead of somewhere specific. Her presence was still there, but it was distributed across the entire landscape, impossible to pinpoint.

Then she opened her eyes and snapped back into focus. The void collapsed back into her body.

"How?" I breathed.

"By letting go of the idea that you are separate from everything else." She smiled gently. "You're holding onto yourself too tightly, Chris. Your ego, your identity, your sense of 'I am here and everything else is there.' That's what makes you visible. You're a knot in the fabric. To hide, you need to untie yourself."

"That sounds like dying."

"It's the opposite. It's remembering that you were never separate in the first place." She gestured to a bench. "Sit. We're going to practice."

I sat, but something twisted in my chest. Watching her disappear like that—effortless, complete, like she'd done it a thousand times—made me feel small. Inadequate. She'd probably been doing this for lifetimes. Ren could fold space without thinking. The Apostles moved through reality like water.

And I could barely quiet a dog without breaking a glass.

"You're comparing," Miriam said softly, reading something in my expression.

"Of course I am. You just... you made it look so easy. And I can't even—" I gestured vaguely at myself. "I'm so far behind."

She sat beside me, her presence warm despite the void I'd felt moments before. "Chris, what you admire in me—that ease, that mastery—where do you think it exists?"

"In you. You've been practicing for—"

"It exists in the frequency itself. In the potential of consciousness. And what is consciousness?"

I thought about what Ren had taught me. "Universal. One thing experiencing itself as many."

"Exactly. So if I can dissolve into everything, and consciousness is universal, then..." She waited.

"Then I can too," I finished, but it felt hollow. Theoretical.

"Not someday. Right now. This moment." She placed a hand on my chest. "The same awareness that flows through me flows through you. The same Source. The difference isn't capacity—it's practice. And even that gap isn't what you think."

"What do you mean?"

"You're not seeing potential in yourself that you admire in me. You're seeing it in me because you're denying it in yourself. I'm a mirror, Chris. Every ability that impresses you, every skill that makes you feel less than—that's showing you what you haven't activated yet. Not what you can never have."

The twist in my chest loosened slightly. "So I'm... envious?"

"Energy," she corrected. "You're feeling energy that wants to move you toward your own development. But your mind labeled it 'envy' and turned it against yourself. Watch what happens when you shift the frequency."

She was quiet for a moment, letting me feel it. The comparison. The inadequacy. The hunger to be as skilled as she was.

"Feel that fully," she said. "Don't judge it. Don't suppress it. Just... what's underneath? What's that feeling actually trying to tell you?"

I closed my eyes, let myself really feel it. And under the comparison, under the not-enough-ness, I found something else.

Hope.

If she could do it, the potential existed. Not in some abstract universe, but in actual human consciousness. Someone had walked this path before. Left footprints.

"Oh," I whispered.

"There it is." Miriam smiled. "Your envy just became aspiration. Same energy. Different frequency. You're not less than me, Chris. You're earlier in the process. And that's actually a gift—you remember what it's like to struggle. When you teach others someday, you'll remember this moment."

"When I teach others?"

"Of course. You think you're learning this just for yourself?" She laughed, the sound like water over stones. "You're going to help millions of people remember they're connected. They'll look at you the way you're looking at me right now. Feeling inadequate. Comparing. And you'll remember this moment and tell them what I'm telling you: We're all the same Source, just at different points in remembering."

The feeling in my chest transformed completely. Still intense, still powerful—but now it felt like fuel. Like possibility. Like I couldn't wait to practice.

"Thank you," I said.

"Don't thank me. Thank yourself for being willing to feel it and let it transform. Most people suppress envy, turn it into resentment, hoard it like poison. You let it alchemize. That's the work." She stood. "Now, let's see if you can dissolve. Not like me—like you. Your way. Your pace. Your unique expression of the same universal potential."

I sat. Ren took a position a few yards away, watching.

"Close your eyes," Miriam instructed. "Feel the frequency. You know how by now."

I did. The humming in my chest, the golden light, the web of connection spreading out in all directions.

"Good. Now, instead of pushing your awareness outward, let it dissolve. Imagine that the boundaries of your body are just suggestions. Let your edges blur. Let yourself seep into everything around you—the ground, the air, the trees, the people in the distance. Don't force it. Just... allow it."

I tried. Tried to let go of the feeling of being a distinct point in space. But every time I started to dissolve, panic would spike and I'd snap back into myself.

"You're afraid," Miriam observed.

"Of what?"

"Of disappearing. Of losing yourself. It's a valid fear. Some people do get lost when they dissolve too far. They forget how to come back. But that won't happen to you today, because Ren and I are here to anchor you. Trust us. Let go."

I took a breath. Another. Then I stopped trying to control it and just... released.

The boundaries blurred.

My awareness spread like water spilling from a cup. I was in the bench, the ground, the air. I was in the trees swaying in the breeze. I was in the tourists starting to arrive, their morning thoughts, their wonder at the view. I was everywhere and nowhere.

And then I felt it—other presences. Distinct points of consciousness that weren't dissolving. People who were holding their shape, their focus.

Three of them. Watching. Assessing.

One was Ren—I recognized his warmth, his patient presence. One was Miriam—steady, strong, protective.

The third was wrong.

It felt cold. Calculating. Like being studied by a predator.

I snapped back into my body, gasping.

"You felt them," Miriam said quietly. It wasn't a question.

"Three of you. But the third one wasn't... wasn't friendly."

Ren's expression darkened. "How far?"

Miriam closed her eyes, her awareness spreading. "Close. Maybe a quarter mile. They're not hiding."

"Who?" I asked, already knowing the answer.

"A Controller," Ren said. "They found you faster than I expected."

"What do they want?"

"To see what you are. To assess if you're a threat or an asset." He stood, scanning the area. "Miriam, can you—"

"Already on it." Her presence expanded again, but this time it felt different—defensive. Like a shield wrapping around the three of us. "They won't be able to pinpoint his exact location now. But Chris, you need to learn this fast. This is how you move through the world without drawing attention."

"How long will they watch me?"

"Until they decide what to do with you," Miriam said. "Which is why we need to get you to the other Apostles. Today. The longer you're exposed, the more danger you're in."

"Danger how? What would they actually do?"

Ren and Miriam exchanged a look.

"In the best case?" Ren said. "They try to recruit you. Offer you power, resources, a place in their organization. Try to convince you that controlling world events is the right path."

"And worst case?"

"They try to eliminate you before you become a problem."

The words hung in the air.

"But I haven't done anything," I said. "I helped some baseball players. I healed a plant. I'm not a threat to anyone."

"You're a potential threat to their entire power structure," Miriam said gently. "If you're who we think you are—if the prophecy is real—then your very existence challenges everything they've built. You represent a path forward that doesn't involve them controlling humanity from the shadows. That makes you dangerous."

I looked out at the city again, at all those millions of lives, and wondered how many of them were being influenced right now by people like the Controllers. How many elections, wars, economic collapses, innovations had been quietly nudged in certain directions by people with access to the frequency.

"When do I meet the rest of The Apostles?"

"Tonight," Ren said. "We have a place. Neutral ground. Everyone's gathering. They'll want to assess you themselves, teach you what they can, and decide on the next steps."

"And until then?"

"Until then," Miriam said, "you practice dissolving. You practice coming back. You learn to move through the world without leaving a trail. Because that Controller out there?" She gestured vaguely toward the city. "They're not alone. There are others. And now they're all going to be looking for you."

---

We spent the next three hours at the Observatory. Miriam was a patient teacher, walking me through the process again and again.

Dissolve. Become the landscape. Spread awareness thin.

Return. Gather yourself. Remember your shape.

Each time got easier. Each time I could hold the dissolved state a little longer. And each time I came back, I could feel that cold presence watching, waiting, somewhere in the distance.

Around noon, my phone buzzed. A text from a number I didn't recognize.

**Unknown:** We should talk. You have questions. We have answers. No pressure. Just coffee. -V

I showed it to Ren.

"They're making contact," he said grimly. "Trying to seem friendly. Reasonable."

"Should I respond?"

"No. They're testing your boundaries. Seeing if you're curious enough to engage. Don't give them anything."

I deleted the message, but I could still feel that presence watching. Patiently. Like they had all the time in the world.

"How many Controllers are there?" I asked.

"In Los Angeles? Maybe thirty active members. Globally?" Miriam shrugged. "Hundreds. Maybe thousands. They've been organizing for centuries. They have resources, influence, people embedded in governments and corporations. They play the long game."

"And how many Apostles?"

"Twelve," Ren said. "Just twelve. Like always."

"That's not exactly balanced."

"No," Miriam agreed. "But we're not trying to match their numbers. We're trying to support the awakening. To guide people like you. Quality over quantity."

Another buzz. Another text.

**Unknown:** The karmic debt must be heavy. Two interventions in one night. We can teach you how to manage that. How to avoid paying the price. -V

I stared at the message. They knew. They knew exactly what I'd done and what it had cost me.

"They're baiting you," Ren said. "Offering solutions to problems they know you're facing. It's how they recruit. They find people struggling with the karmic returns and offer them a way out."

"Is there a way out?"

"Not one that doesn't involve hurting other people," Miriam said firmly. "The Controllers have learned to deflect their karmic debt. To push it onto others who don't know what's happening. It's a violation of the highest order. It's why we oppose them."

I thought about that. About living a life where I could use the frequency freely, without consequences, by making other people suffer for my choices.

"That's monstrous."

"Yes," Ren said simply. "It is. And they don't see it that way. They see it as pragmatism. As necessary for the greater good. They believe they're saving humanity by steering us away from self-destruction. And maybe some of them genuinely believe that. But the cost..." He shook his head. "The cost is always paid by someone who didn't choose it."

I blocked the number.

Thirty seconds later, a different number texted.

**Unknown:** Blocking won't help, Christian. We're not going away. We just want to talk. One conversation. What are you afraid of? -V

They knew my full name. Not just Chris—Christian.

"How do they know so much about me?"

"They have resources," Miriam said. "Probably pulled every record, every database entry, every digital footprint you've ever left. They're thorough."

"So what do I do?"

"You come with us," Ren said. "Tonight. Meet The Apostles. Let us teach you how to protect yourself. And then..." He paused. "Then we figure out what you're meant to do. Together."

I looked at my phone, at the messages from V—whoever they were—and felt the weight of what was happening.

I'd woken up something I didn't understand. And now two ancient factions were circling, both wanting me for very different reasons.

"Okay," I said. "Let's go meet The Apostles."

Miriam smiled. "Good. But first, one more lesson."

She stood, walking to the edge of the parking lot where it overlooked the city.

"Come here."

I joined her. From this height, Los Angeles spread out like a living organism, pulsing with life.

"What do you feel?" she asked.

I closed my eyes, let my awareness spread. The frequency showed me everything—the joy, the pain, the mundane moments, the profound ones. Millions of stories happening simultaneously.

"Chaos," I said. "Beautiful chaos."

"Look deeper. Past the individuals. What's underneath?"

I pushed my awareness further, trying to feel the pattern beneath the noise.

And then I felt it. A rhythm. A pulse. Like a heartbeat, but slower, deeper. The collective consciousness of the city itself, breathing.

"The city is alive," I whispered.

"Everything is alive," Miriam corrected. "Everything is conscious at some level. Cities, forests, oceans, the planet itself. The frequency doesn't just connect people, Chris. It connects everything. And if you're going to help humanity awaken—if that's truly your path—you need to understand that we're not separate from the Earth. We're part of it. And it's been waiting for us to remember."

I opened my eyes, looking at her.

"That's what the prophecy is really about, isn't it? Not just uniting humanity. Uniting humanity with everything else."

She nodded slowly. "The next stage of evolution isn't technological. It's consciousness. It's remembering that we were never alone. Never separate. That we're one living system trying to understand itself."

"And the Controllers?"

"They want to control that evolution. To guide it according to their plan. They think they know better than the organic unfolding of universal consciousness." Her expression was sad. "They're not evil, Chris. But they're wrong. And they're dangerous because they're so certain they're right."

My phone buzzed again. I didn't look at it.

"Let them watch," I said. "Let them send their messages. I'm not interested in their way."

Ren grinned. "Now you're getting it."

We left the Observatory around 2 PM. As we walked to our cars, I practiced what Miriam had taught me—dissolving my presence, spreading it thin, becoming invisible in plain sight.

That cold, watching presence tried to follow. But it couldn't quite pinpoint me anymore.

I was learning to hide.

But more importantly, I was learning why I needed to.
