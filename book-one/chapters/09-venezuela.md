# CHAPTER NINE: VENEZUELA

Sophia and I had barely spoken since Myanmar.

Not because we were avoiding each other—we couldn't avoid each other anymore, could feel each other's presence constantly now, a gentle hum in the background of our awareness no matter how much distance we put between us.

But because what do you SAY to someone after you've literally merged consciousnesses with them in front of 25,000 people? After you've felt every thought, every fear, every secret desire?

After you've experienced something so profound it made the idea of being with anyone else feel like settling?

We finally ended up alone three days later, on a balcony overlooking the monastery gardens. The sun was setting, painting everything in shades of gold.

"I can still feel you," Sophia said quietly, hands gripped on the railing. "Like you're a radio station that's always playing. Not loud. Just... there. Always there."

"I know. I feel you too."

She turned to face me, tears in her eyes. "I'm terrified, Chris. Of losing myself. I merged with you, and it was BEAUTIFUL, and for a moment I wasn't me anymore, I was US, and I... What if I disappear?"

"You won't."

"How do you KNOW?"

"Because I felt the same terror. I thought I'd lose my identity. But instead I became MORE. More whole. Like I'd been trying to function as half a being and suddenly remembered I could be WHOLE."

She was quiet, looking at the gardens.

"I saw inside you," she said. "I saw your fear of not being enough. Your terror of failing everyone. And you saw inside me."

"Yeah. I saw your fear of being too much. The exhaustion of holding space for the world."

"Does it change things? Knowing each other that completely?"

"I don't know. Does it?"

"I went on a date yesterday. Lasted twenty minutes. He was nice. Attractive. Everything I should want. And I just kept thinking, 'This is absolutely nothing compared to what I felt when I merged with Chris.'"

"I've been having the same problem," I admitted. "Every time I try to date someone, I think, 'This will never be what I have with Sophia.'"

She turned fully. "What ARE we, Chris? We're not dating. We've never kissed. But I've MERGED SOULS with you. What the hell is that?"

"I have no idea. Twin flames? Soul mates? Take your pick."

"Those all sound made up."

"They probably are. But that doesn't mean they're wrong."

She moved closer, that familiar hum intensifying. "I don't want to lose what we have by trying to make it something it's not."

"What do we have?"

"Partnership? Balance? Soul-forging?" She took my hand. "You're the forge where I refine my soul, Chris. Being with you, training with you, merging with you—it burns away everything that isn't TRUE. And that's terrifying and beautiful and nothing like what people mean when they say they're 'in love.'"

"You're my forge too. You make me MORE."

"So maybe we're not romantic. Maybe we're something that doesn't have a name yet."

"And maybe that's okay?"

"Maybe that's perfect."

I pulled her into a hug—and it was just a hug, except it wasn't because I could feel her soul pressed against mine, could feel the truth that we'd ruined each other for anyone else.

"I'm glad you're my forge," I whispered.

"I'm glad you're mine."

Forge-mates, she'd said later.

Yeah. That felt right.

# CHAPTER NINE: VENEZUELA (continued)

**THREE WEEKS AFTER MYANMAR - THE FORGE**

I'd been staring at the ceiling for an hour when Vale found me.

"You're avoiding," she whisper-said from the doorway.

"I'm resting. There's a difference."

"Is there?" She entered my room, moved to the window. Morning light filtered through. "Myanmar was three weeks ago. The karmic fever passed after four days. Your energy is 80% restored. And yet you're still in bed at noon, telling everyone you're not ready for Venezuela."

I sat up, defensive. "I'm not ready. I'm exhausted. Myanmar nearly killed me. I need more time."

"Or you're afraid Venezuela will be harder. That you won't be able to replicate Myanmar's success. That people will die and you'll be responsible." She turned to look at me. "Which is it? Sacred rest or sacred avoidance?"

The question hung in the air.

"I don't know," I admitted.

"Then let's find out." She sat on the edge of the bed. "Close your eyes. Drop into body awareness. Not your mind—your mind will rationalize either direction. Feel your actual energy state. Is the tank empty or are you afraid to spend what's left?"

I closed my eyes. Dropped deeper than thought. Into pure sensation.

And found... reserves. Real ones. Not full—Myanmar had cost me—but available. Enough for Venezuela if I didn't try to do it alone. If I let the Apostles support me. If I trusted the network.

The exhaustion I'd been feeling was real, but only about 30%. The other 70% was fear wearing tiredness's mask.

"I'm afraid," I whispered. "I'm afraid people will die. I'm afraid I'll fail. I'm afraid Myanmar was beginner's luck and Venezuela will expose that I'm not actually ready for this."

"Good. Now you're being honest." Vale's voice was soft. "Chris, you're at a choice point. You can rest another week out of genuine need—and I'll support that completely. Or you can act from the 70% available energy you actually have, trusting that the work itself will restore the final 30%."

"How do I choose?"

"You already know. Your body told you the truth. The question is: Will you trust it?"

I sat with it. Felt the fear. Felt the available energy. Felt the difference between sacred rest (honoring depletion) and sloth (avoiding challenge because it's hard).

I was being lazy. Not physically—spiritually. Avoiding growth by pretending I needed more recovery.

"Three days," I said. "Give me three days of real rest. Intentional integration. Then I go to Venezuela. Not forcing. Not avoiding. Choosing from wholeness."

Vale smiled, rare for her. "That's wisdom. You're learning to discern instead of defaulting to extremes. Some people always push through depletion and burn out. Others always avoid and never grow. You're learning the middle path—rest when you truly need it, act when you're genuinely ready, and trust your body to know the difference."

I rested three days. Actual rest. Deep sleep. Gentle walks. Integration meditation. And on day four, I woke up ready. The fear was still there—but the avoidance was gone.

"Venezuela," I told the twelve. "I'm ready."

But first, something needed to be addressed.

---

That evening, as we prepared for Venezuela, Sophia pulled me aside.

"We need to talk," she said. "About what happened in Myanmar. About us."

And I knew she was right. We couldn't keep avoiding it.

But that conversation—and what came next—would change everything.
