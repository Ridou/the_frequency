# CHAPTER FOUR: THE CIRCLE

The text came at 2:47 AM.

**REN:** Meet me at Echo Park Lake. East side, by the lotus beds. 3 AM. Come alone.

I'd barely slept anyway. The frequency hummed constantly now, a background noise I couldn't silence. Every car passing my building, every neighbor's dream, every heartbeat in the apartment complex—I felt all of it, a symphony of existence that never stopped playing.

I got dressed, called an Uber, tried not to think about how insane this was. Meeting someone at a lake at 3 AM. Following instructions from a guy who claimed to be an immortal soul-guide. Learning to use cosmic powers that violated every law of physics I'd ever known.

Just another Thursday.

Echo Park Lake sat in the middle of one of LA's oldest neighborhoods, a pocket of nature surrounded by urban sprawl. At 3 AM, it was deserted—or should have been. But as I walked along the eastern path, I saw them.

Twelve figures standing in a circle near the water's edge. The lotus beds floated behind them like dark shadows on the still water. And the air—the air felt different. Thicker. More present. Like reality itself was holding its breath.

Ren stood at the north point of the circle. He gestured for me to approach.

"Chris," he said as I got close enough. "Thank you for coming. I know this must seem—"

"Completely insane?" I offered. "Yeah. It does."

One of the figures laughed—a woman with silver-streaked hair pulled into intricate braids. "I like him already. He's got that quality."

"What quality?" I asked.

"Healthy skepticism mixed with curiosity. It's rare." She stepped forward, extending her hand. "Kael. I question everything. It's my job."

I shook her hand. Her grip was firm, her eyes sharp and assessing. Not hostile—just intensely present.

"Chris," Ren continued, "you're about to meet The Apostles. The twelve I told you about. We're only all together like this a few times a year. But when a potential awakener appears, we gather. To witness. To assess. To welcome... or warn."

"Warn?"

A massive man stepped out of the circle—easily six-five, built like a fighter, covered in scars that told stories I probably didn't want to know. "If you'd awakened wrong," he said in a voice like gravel, "we'd be here to stop you. Before you could hurt people. Before the Controllers could recruit you." He smiled, but it wasn't reassuring. "I'm Nox. I work with shadows."

"Shadows?"

"The space between light. The unmanifest. Most people fear it. I teach people to use it." He gestured around the circle. "We each have a specialty. A way we connect to Source. You're about to get a crash course in all of them."

Ren motioned me toward the center of the circle. "We're going somewhere first. Somewhere... special. It's 3 AM—the hour when the city dreams. When the boundary between here and elsewhere gets thin. Perfect time for a fold."

"A what?"

But before I could get an answer, the twelve raised their hands in unison. I felt it immediately—a massive surge in the frequency. All twelve of them, working together, creating something.

The air in front of me rippled. Not metaphorically. Actually rippled, like someone had dropped a stone in a pond, except the pond was reality itself.

And then a door appeared.

Not a physical door. A fold in space. An opening to somewhere else.

"Step through," Ren said gently. "We'll be right behind you. Trust me."

I looked at the impossible door floating in mid-air above the lotus beds. Looked at the twelve Apostles watching me with expressions ranging from curiosity to anticipation to caution.

And I stepped through.

---

The impossible room.

That's the only way to describe it. The geometry was wrong. Walls met at angles that shouldn't work. The ceiling was both infinitely high and uncomfortably close. And floating in the center, defying gravity and sense, was a circular table with twelve chairs arranged around it.

I stumbled as I entered, my brain struggling to process space that didn't follow Euclidean rules. Ren's hand caught my elbow, steadying me.

"It gets easier," he said. "The first time is always disorienting. This place exists... between. Between here and there. Between now and then. A space we created for meetings that need to happen outside normal reality."

The other Apostles filed in behind us, but I stopped counting at eleven.

Because there were thirteen figures in the room.

The thirteenth stood slightly apart from the forming circle, near Miriam, looking as overwhelmed as I felt. A woman, late twenties, long dark hair in a loose braid that fell over one shoulder. She wore faded jeans and a hoodie that said "ERAS TOUR 2023" in letters that had clearly survived too many concerts and washing machines. Stacks of colorful friendship bracelets covered both wrists, and a small moonstone pendant caught the light at her throat.

She looked up as I fully entered the room.

Our eyes met.

The room *hummed*.

I mean that literally—a low frequency vibration that made the air shimmer between us, like heat waves off summer pavement. The sound wasn't audible exactly, more like something I felt in my bones, in my teeth, in the base of my skull.

Several of the Apostles looked up sharply. Kael raised an eyebrow. Tao's face broke into a slow, knowing smile. Sable's spiral tattoos seemed to pulse in rhythm with the vibration.

The woman's hand flew to her chest, eyes wide with shock. "What is—"

"What the hell?" I managed, unable to look away from her. Those eyes—deep brown with flecks of gold, like Earth itself looking back at me.

She took a shaky breath. "You're... doing something. To my chest. It's vibrating."

"I'm not doing anything," I said, but even as I said it, I knew it wasn't true. Something WAS happening. Something between us. "Are you doing something to ME?"

"I don't even know what I CAN do yet!" Her voice had a musical quality, like she was used to listening to harmonics most people couldn't hear. "I just got here three days ago. I'm still trying to figure out if I'm having a psychotic break or if this is real."

"It's real," I said automatically. "Trust me, I had the same question last week."

Ren stepped forward, that slight smile still playing at his lips. "Chris, this is Sophia. Sophia, Chris. Why don't you both take your positions in the circle, and we'll begin."

"That's it?" I asked. "No explanation for why the room is vibrating when we look at each other?"

"Some things," Ren said mysteriously, "are better experienced than explained."

Sophia and I exchanged uncertain glances as the Twelve arranged themselves around the table—twelve chairs, and two seats left for us. Me at one point, Sophia directly across, the diameter of the space between us.

The hum didn't stop. If anything, it got stronger.

"Is this normal?" Sophia asked the room at large.

Miriam's smile was warm but cryptic. "Define normal."

"Is anyone else feeling this?" I pressed.

The Twelve exchanged glances—knowing, amused, maddeningly unhelpful.

"We'll discuss what you're experiencing after today's training," Kael said. "For now, just... observe it. Don't fight it. Don't force it. Just let it be."

I looked across the table at Sophia—this stranger who somehow didn't feel like a stranger at all, whose presence made the air sing with recognition.

She looked back at me, hand still on her chest, feeling that same vibration.

We didn't know what we were to each other yet.

But we both knew it was something.

Something that felt like coming home to a place I'd never been, meeting someone I'd always known.

I didn't know if that was beautiful or terrifying.

Watching the way Sophia's eyes widened as she felt what I felt, I suspected she had the same question.

Probably both.

I sat, feeling the significance of the moment even if I didn't fully understand it.

Kael spoke first. "Let's not waste time. Chris, you awakened three days ago. You've learned the basics from Ren. You know about the frequency, about karmic return, about the two factions in the Society. What you don't know is why we're really here. What we're actually trying to do."

She leaned forward, her braided hair catching light that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.

"The world is reaching a threshold. Humanity is at a crossroads. We either evolve—collectively, consciously—or we destroy ourselves. Climate collapse. Nuclear war. Technological dystopia. Pick your apocalypse. But there's another path. One where we remember we're one organism on one living planet. Where we act as one consciousness instead of seven billion competing individuals."

Another figure spoke—lean, covered in tattoos that seemed to pulse with their own rhythm. "I'm Sable. I study patterns. The same patterns repeat across all scales—DNA spirals the same way galaxies do. Fractals echo from quantum to cosmic. And there's a pattern in human consciousness too. Every few thousand years, we hit a threshold. A moment where we either leap forward or fall back."

"And we're at one of those moments now," said a woman whose presence felt somehow larger than her physical form. She had this quality of being deeply still even while speaking. "I'm Vale. I teach stillness. The moment we're in requires both action and patience. Both courage and wisdom."

A younger person—maybe early thirties, practically vibrating with energy—jumped in. "I'm Ash. The catalyst. The spark. Chris, what you felt three days ago? That was just the beginning. You have a gift. The ability to amplify people's connection to Source. To help them remember what they've forgotten. That's rare. Extremely rare."

"How rare?" I asked.

"Last person who could do it at your level?" Ren said quietly. "Yeshua. Two thousand years ago."

The weight of that hung in the air.

"Don't," Kael warned. "Don't put that pressure on him yet. He just awakened. Let him breathe."

But a weathered man with eyes that had seen too much spoke anyway. "I'm Tao. I've walked this path more times than I can count. Across different lives, different iterations. And I can tell you this: you're going to need endurance. Not the kind that powers through pain. The kind that finds a sustainable pace. This work will take decades. Maybe lifetimes. Don't sprint. Learn to walk forever."

"I'm Iris," said a woman who looked barely thirty but felt infinitely older. "I see timelines. Probability streams. All the possible futures branching from every choice. Right now, because of you, the timelines are shifting. Futures that were unlikely are becoming possible. But it's not guaranteed. Every choice matters."

"I'm Jin," said someone with ink-stained fingers and a thoughtful expression. "I witness. I record. I translate what can't be spoken into what can be written. Someone needs to remember how this happens. What works. What doesn't. So those who come after can learn."

"Rook." A person whose presence kept sliding out of focus, hard to pin down even when looking directly at them. "I move through blind spots. The gaps in perception. In a world of surveillance, invisibility is survival. I'll teach you how to hide when you need to."

A woman I recognized from yesterday spoke next. "Miriam. You've met me. Cloaking. Dissolving. Teaching people to remember they're not separate from everything else."

And finally, a massive presence that felt less like a person and more like a force of nature. "Zara. I bridge opposites. Masculine and feminine. Spirit and matter. Light and shadow. You're going to need to integrate all of them, not choose between them."

I looked around the table. Twelve people. Twelve specialties. Twelve approaches to the same fundamental truth.

"Why me?" I asked finally. "Why am I here?"

Ren smiled. "Because you have the gift of amplification. Because your instinct was to help, not control. Because you're here at the right time. And because..." He paused. "Because we've been waiting. There's a thirteenth role. Not one of us. Someone who completes the circle. Someone who catalyzes the awakening."

"You think that's me."

"We think it might be," Kael corrected. "Time will tell. But the signs are there."

"What signs?"

Iris spoke. "The timing of your awakening. The speed at which you're learning. The way the frequency responds to you. And..." She gestured to the wall behind me.

I turned. And saw it for the first time.

The Wall of Names.

Hundreds—thousands—of names carved into the impossible surface. Different languages. Different alphabets. Some carved deep, some faded with age. And as I looked at them, they began to shift, to translate themselves into English in my mind. Not through my eyes. Through the frequency.

"Every person who sat in this circle," Ren explained. "Across all the iterations. All the times we've gathered. All the attempts we've made to help humanity evolve. Some names you'd recognize from history. Most you wouldn't. Because most of our work happens in the shadows. Quiet. Unseen."

I stepped closer, my hand hovering over the carved surface. The stone was warm. Alive with memory.

And then I started seeing things that weren't just names.

Near the top, carved in what looked like ancient Hebrew: אמת

"Emet," Aramis said quietly, appearing at my shoulder. "Truth. The word God spoke to create. It appears seventeen times on this Wall. Always near threshold moments."

"Seventeen?"

"Add the digits. One plus seven equals eight. Infinity turned vertical. Cycles without end."

I moved my gaze across the Wall, and patterns started emerging. Not random. Deliberate. Mathematical.

A date carved multiple times in different scripts: **December 21, 2012**

"The Mayan calendar," I said.

"One threshold," Sable's voice, from behind me. "Not the end. A shift. From one age to another. The precession of equinoxes. Every 2,160 years, Earth's axis points to a different constellation. We moved from Pisces—the age of religion, belief, faith—into Aquarius. The age of consciousness, knowing, direct experience."

My finger traced lower. Found a drawing etched into the stone: A figure hanging upside down, one leg crossed in a triangle. Hands bound behind the back.

"The Hanged Man," Kael said. "Major Arcana number twelve. Willing sacrifice. Perspective shift. Seeing the world inverted. Yeshua hung on wood. Same symbolism. Same willing surrender to transformation."

I was starting to understand. This wasn't just a memorial. It was a code. A message system across time.

"The Pattern," I said slowly. "Each iteration leaves messages for the next."

"Exactly." Aramis traced a finger across a series of numbers: 3.14159265...

"Pi?" I asked.

"Backwards. Reversed. The circle unwinding. Reality deconstructed to show its mathematical bones. As above, so below—even numbers contain consciousness."

My eyes caught on something else. A name that made my breath stop.

**CHRISTIAN RAND**

But it was carved as an anagram, letters scattered and reassembled:

**ARCADIAN STAR**

Beneath it, another arrangement of the same letters:

**A RADIANT SCAR**

And below that:

**ASCENDANT LAIR**

"My name," I whispered. "How—I haven't carved anything."

"You will," Iris said simply. "Time isn't linear in this room. You're reading your own message to yourself. Past and future communicating through carved stone that exists outside time's usual flow."

I felt dizzy. Reached out to steady myself against the Wall.

And my hand landed on a message in old Aramaic. Letters I shouldn't be able to read—but somehow, through the frequency, I could.

*"To the one who comes after: Do not carry this alone. I tried. I nearly broke. Let them share the burden. Transformation doesn't require crucifixion—that was my iteration's limitation, not yours. Find a new ending."*

"Yeshua," I breathed.

"He left that message two thousand years ago," Aramis said quietly. "Every iteration, he's tried to warn the next one. Don't walk the path alone. Don't let them make you into a martyr. Find a different way."

I traced the letters, feeling the weight of consciousness that had carved them. A man who'd carried the weight of transformation and been crucified for it. Trying across time itself to save me from the same fate.

Tears blurred my vision.

Below his message, I found another set of symbols. Tarot cards etched into stone:

**0 - The Fool** (beginning the journey, innocent, willing)
**1 - The Magician** (awakening to power)
**7 - The Chariot** (willpower, direction)
**12 - The Hanged Man** (surrender, perspective shift)
**13 - Death** (transformation without dying)
**21 - The World** (completion, unity, return)

"Your journey," Sable said. "Mapped in Tarot because the Major Arcana is archetypal. It's not prediction—it's pattern recognition. Consciousness evolves through these same stages whether it's an individual awakening or a species awakening. The pattern is fractal. Same at all scales."

"Every person who sat in this circle," Ren said, gesturing to the thousands of names, "added to the Wall. Encoded their wisdom. Left messages for future iterations. This is our institutional memory. Our transmission across time. And someday, Chris, you'll carve your own message. Your own wisdom. Your own warning or encouragement for whoever comes next."

I looked at the anagrams of my name again. ARCADIAN STAR. RADIANT SCAR. ASCENDANT LAIR.

"My name contains all possibilities," I said slowly.

"All names do," Aramis replied. "But yours was chosen—by you, before you incarnated—to reflect the Pattern you'd walk. Paradise consciousness. Wound that heals. The place where transformation happens. All encoded in the letters your parents thought they chose randomly."

The Wall seemed to pulse with accumulated wisdom. Messages in Sanskrit, Latin, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Mathematical formulas. Sacred geometry. Alchemical symbols. All of it saying the same thing in different languages:

*You are not alone. You've never been alone. We've walked this path before. We're walking it with you now. And we'll walk it again in the future. The Pattern continues. Trust it.*

"Every person who sat in this circle," Ren explained one more time, his voice heavy with meaning. "Across all the iterations. All the times we've gathered. All the attempts we've made to help humanity evolve. Some names you'd recognize from history. Most you wouldn't. Because most of our work happens in the shadows. Quiet. Unseen."

I stood, walked to the wall, ran my fingers over the carvings. And then I felt something. A message. Not carved, but left in the frequency itself. Embedded in the wall for someone to find.

*The work is not heavy. You only feel the weight when you carry it alone. Share the burden. Let others help. You are not the hero. We all are.*

The message was signed with a single letter: M.

"Who was M?" I asked.

The twelve exchanged glances.

"Someone who tried to do it alone," Tao said sadly. "Someone who thought they had to be the sole savior. They burned bright. Burned fast. Almost broke completely. We lost them before the work was done."

"Don't be M," Kael said firmly. "Learn from their mistake. This is collective work. Shared burden. You're the catalyst, yes. But not the only actor. Not the sole carrier. Understand?"

I nodded, still feeling the resonance of M's message.

Another message caught my attention. Newer. Fresher.

*Love is the only frequency that never needs balancing. It is its own return. Trust this when the karmic costs feel too heavy.*

Signed: Z.

"Who's Z?" I asked.

"Someone from three iterations ago," Jin said. "Someone who discovered that pure love—true connection without agenda—doesn't create karmic debt. Because love is already balanced. It's Source recognizing itself."

I read more messages. Wisdom earned through trial and error. Warnings about overextending. Encouragement for dark moments. Reminders that the work was worth it.

And then I felt Ren's hand on my shoulder.

"Chris," he said softly. "There's something you should know. Something we debated telling you now or later. We decided on now."

The twelve gathered closer.

"There's a prophecy," Kael said. "Very old. It speaks of someone who will unite the divided. Who will help Earth become one consciousness. Who will prepare humanity for... what comes after."

"After?"

"After planetary civilization," Iris said. "Earth is our training ground. But it's not the endpoint. There's a larger community. A galactic civilization. We're not ready for it yet. Won't be for generations. But someone has to start the work. Someone has to catalyze the shift from nation-states to planetary identity. From separated consciousness to unified awareness."

"And you think that's me."

"We think you might be the catalyst," Ren corrected. "But only if you choose it. Free will is sacred. We won't force this. We won't manipulate you. We're offering you training, protection, support. But the choice to step into this role? That's yours alone."

I looked around the impossible room. At the twelve Apostles. At the Wall of Names. At the thirteenth chair I was sitting in.

"What happens if I say no?"

"Then you go home," Vale said simply. "We teach you to control your abilities enough to live a normal life. We protect you from the Controllers. And we wait for the next potential awakener. No judgment. No pressure."

"And if I say yes?"

"Then tomorrow we begin real training," Nox said. "Not the basics. The deep work. Folding space. Reading timelines. Amplifying crowds. Everything you'll need to actually help transform the world."

Zara leaned forward. "But understand this: saying yes means accepting that your comfortable life is over. You won't go back to tech support. Won't have normal relationships. Won't be invisible. The Controllers will target you. The Society will split over you. Some will worship you. Some will try to destroy you. Are you ready for that?"

I thought about M. About burning bright and burning out. About carrying the weight alone.

Then I thought about the message from Z. About love being its own return.

"If I do this," I said slowly, "I need a promise from all of you."

"What promise?" Kael asked.

"That you won't let me do it alone. That this is actually shared work, not just words. That if I start carrying too much weight, you'll tell me. That if I start to break like M, you'll catch me."

The twelve looked at each other. Then, one by one, they nodded.

"We promise," Ren said for all of them. "That's why we're the twelve and you're the thirteenth. Shared burden. No one carries alone."

I stood. Placed my hand on the Wall of Names. And spoke clearly.

"Then yes. I'm in. Teach me. Protect me. And let's do this together."

The frequency in the room surged. All twelve Apostles glowing with golden light. And I felt it—their acceptance, their commitment, their readiness.

The circle was complete.

The work could begin.

---

Later, after the meeting dissolved and the Apostles began to fade back through the fold to their own lives, Ren found me on a balcony that shouldn't have existed in the impossible room but did anyway.

I was staring at the city lights below—or what looked like city lights. In this between-space, I couldn't be sure what was real and what was reflection.

"Quite a day, huh?" Ren said, joining me at the railing.

I laughed—slightly manic edge to it. "Understatement of the fucking century. I just met twelve immortal mystics who told me I might be some kind of prophesied savior of humanity. So yeah. Quite a day."

They stood in silence for a moment. The city hummed below them—millions of people living regular lives, unaware that reality had just cracked open for one ordinary tech support worker who happened to love baseball.

Ren's heart was hammering. Three years of deception pressing down on him like gravity, like the weight of the universe demanding truth. *Tell him. Tell him NOW. Before he finds out another way. Before trust becomes impossible to rebuild.*

"Chris, there's something I need to tell you."

Something in Ren's tone made me turn fully, wariness creeping into my eyes. "What?"

The words felt like stones in his mouth. Each one heavy. Each one necessary. "Three years ago, Tao came to me with an assignment."

I waited. Silent.

"He'd identified a potential Pattern. Said I should find him. Be his friend. Be there when he awakened." Ren forced himself to meet my eyes. "I'm saying I was sent to find you. Our meeting wasn't coincidence. I knew who you were—what you might become—before we ever met."

The silence that followed was the kind that has weight. Physical pressure. The kind that precedes earthquakes or the moment before glass shatters.

"You're telling me," my voice was dangerously quiet, every word precise, "that our entire friendship was an assignment?"

"No. Yes. Fuck." Ren ran his hand through his hair, the gesture I'd seen a thousand times now taking on different meaning. "I was assigned to be near you. To position myself as someone you'd trust when the time came. But everything else—the friendship, the late-night talks about life and meaning and whether the Dodgers would ever win another Series—that was REAL. That was MY choice."

"How am I supposed to believe that?" My voice cracked like ice under pressure. "How do I know ANY of it was real? Maybe you're just really fucking good at your job. Maybe I'm just a mission to you. Another box to check for the immortal mystics."

The accusation hit like a physical blow. Ren felt it land in his chest, settle there like a stone. "You were a mission," he admitted. "For about three months. Then you became my friend. My actual, genuine, *chosen* friend. The mission was proximity. Everything I felt after that—that was choice."

"Three years, Ren." I turned away, gripping the railing so hard my knuckles went white. "THREE YEARS you've been lying to me."

"I wasn't lying about loving you like a brother. I wasn't lying about giving a shit when your grandmother died and you couldn't sleep for weeks. I wasn't lying when I said you mattered to me." Ren's voice broke. "I was lying about how we met. About why I was there. And I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry, Chris."

I was quiet for a long time. Ren let the silence sit. Didn't try to fill it with justifications or explanations or pleas. Just let me feel what I was feeling. Process what I needed to process.

Finally, I spoke, voice small now, young: "Did Tao tell you to say all that too? Is this part of the manipulation? Keep me thinking we're friends so I'm easier to control?"

The question landed like a knife between the ribs.

"No. God, no." Ren took a shaky breath. "This is me, risking everything, telling you the truth because you DESERVE the truth. Even if it means you hate me. Even if it means I lose you." He paused, gathering courage. "I was sent to find you. I chose to love you. Both things are true."

"I don't know if I can trust you."

"I know."

"I don't know if I can forgive this."

"I know."

"But I also don't know if I can do this without you." My voice cracked completely now. "Is that fucked up? That I still need you even though you lied to me?"

"It's human." Ren moved carefully—giving me space to reject him if needed. "Look, I don't expect forgiveness. I don't expect trust. I just... I'm not going anywhere. Assignment or not, you're stuck with me. Unless you tell me to leave. Then I'll go. But until you say those words, I'm here."

I turned to look at him, really look at him, and Ren saw everything on my face—the betrayal, the confusion, the anger, and underneath it all, the three years of genuine friendship that didn't stop being real just because it started from a lie.

"Why tell me now?" I asked. "Why not just let me never know?"

"Because you'd figure it out eventually. And I'd rather lose you for telling the truth than keep you through deception." Ren met my eyes. "And because Tao told me: 'Be his genuine friend or don't do this at all.' If I kept lying, I wouldn't BE your friend. I'd just be playing a role."

"I hate that this makes sense."

"I hate that I put you in this position."

"I need time. To process this. To figure out if I can trust you again."

"Take all the time you need. I'll be here. Not because Tao told me to. Because I choose to."

I nodded slowly. Didn't say it was okay—because it wasn't okay. Didn't say I forgave Ren—because I didn't, not yet. Just: "Okay."

And Ren had to let that be enough.

We stood there in uncomfortable silence, something broken between us that might heal stronger or might never heal at all. Below them, the city continued its oblivious existence. Traffic flowed. Lights blinked. Life went on.

But up here, in this impossible space, everything had changed.

"I'm going inside," I said finally. "I need... I need to not be around you right now."

Each word was a small death, but Ren nodded. "I understand."

I walked to the door, then paused. Didn't turn around. Just said, quietly: "For what it's worth? The friendship felt real to me. All three years. I just don't know what's real and what I imagined now."

Then I was gone.

Ren stood alone on the balcony, the weight of three years of deception settling onto his shoulders fully now. No more secret to carry. Just the consequences of choices he'd made when he thought he was doing the right thing.

Behind him, footsteps. He turned to find Miriam standing there, her silver-streaked hair loose around her shoulders, expression gentle.

"That took courage," she said simply.

"Doesn't feel courageous. Feels like I just destroyed the best friendship I've ever had."

"Maybe. Or maybe you just saved it." She moved to stand beside him, both of them looking out at the city. "Lies compound, Ren. Truth hurts clean. You gave him clean pain. That can heal."

"What if he never forgives me?"

"Then you'll carry that pain. With love." She placed a hand on his shoulder. "Tao gave you an impossible task. Be someone's genuine friend while deceiving them about why you're there. You did your best. Now you're doing better. That matters."

After she left, Ren stood there for a long time, watching the city lights blur through tears he didn't bother hiding.

He'd told the truth.

Now he had to live with whether that truth destroyed what mattered most.
