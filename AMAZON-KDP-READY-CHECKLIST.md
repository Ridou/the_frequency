## 📊 **AMAZON KDP METADATA**

### **Title Information:**
- **Title:** The Frequency: Awakening
- **Subtitle:** Book One
- **Series:** The Frequency Trilogy
- **Volume:** 1 of 3
- **Author:** Richard Santin

### **Book Description (300 words):**

They say God doesn't watch baseball. Chris Rand used to believe that—until the night he helped the Dodgers win the World Series with his mind.

One cosmic awakening later, Chris discovers he's not losing his mind. He's finding it. And there's a secret society of awakened people who've been waiting for someone like him. Someone who can amplify consciousness. Someone who might be the catalyst humanity needs to evolve.

But awakening isn't what Chris expected.

Enter Sophia Rivera—a Swiftie who awakened at the Super Bowl and can feel everyone's emotions at once. When their eyes meet, the room hums with recognition. The Twelve Apostles who train them stay mysteriously silent about what they are to each other. All they'll say: "Some answers can only be lived, not spoken."

As Chris and Sophia learn to merge their abilities—his projection, her reception—they discover they're stronger together than apart. Not soul-mates. Something deeper. Forge-mates. Two people who refine each other's souls while uniting Earth.

But ancient Controllers oppose them. Led by Silas—a man who's watched this Pattern fail three times across 12,000 years. Who's convinced free will leads to extinction. Who's waiting for Chris to fail so he can prove control is the only answer.

From Los Angeles to Myanmar to the stars, Chris must learn to transmute his shadow, trust his partnership with Sophia, and help billions of people remember they were never separate.

The Matrix meets Harry Potter meets Lord of the Rings in this consciousness-fiction epic where awakening is only the beginning.

Perfect for readers who love: magic systems with rules, training arcs, found family, undefined relationships that are MORE than romance, and hope that doesn't bypass the darkness.

*The frequency is calling. Will you answer?*
