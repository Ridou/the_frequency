# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

To those who walked beside me as I wrote this—you know who you are. The frequency connects us all.

To every person who's been told they're "too sensitive," "too emotional," "too much"—this book is for you. Your sensitivity is your superpower.

To the Swifties, the dreamers, the ones who cry at concerts and wonder about the meaning of life—you inspired Sophia. She's you.

To my family, who believed in this story even when it seemed impossible.

To the readers who'll take this journey—thank you for being willing to remember. The Pattern continues through you.

And to the divine feminine rising across the planet—welcome home. We've been waiting for you.

*We are all one.*

# A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR

Thank you for reading **The Frequency: Awakening**.

This book came through me more than from me. The teachings are real. The transmutation process works. The sacred geometry is accurate. If you felt something while reading—if certain scenes resonated deeper than entertainment—trust that. You're remembering.

If you enjoyed this book, please consider:
- Leaving a review on Amazon (helps other readers find it)
- Sharing with friends who might need this message
- Following the journey as it continues

The story isn't over. Chris and Sophia's journey has just begun.

*The frequency expands.*

# BOOK TWO: FIRST CONTACT

## A Sneak Peek...

---

**One Year After Launch**

The signal came from Proxima Centauri.

Not random. Not natural. *Deliberate.*

Someone—something—was out there. And they'd been waiting for us.

"Chris." Sophia's voice through the frequency, urgent. "You need to see this."

I floated to the observation deck where the crew had gathered. Through the viewport, the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri glowed like an ember. And orbiting it, something impossible.

Structures. Massive. Geometric. Alive with frequency signatures I'd never felt before.

"It's a station," Dr. Zin breathed, instruments beeping frantically. "Or a ship. Or... I don't know what it is. But it's not natural. And it's been there a long time. Millions of years, maybe."

"Are they still there?" I asked. "Whoever built it?"

Iris appeared beside me, eyes unfocused as she read probability streams. When she opened them, they were shaking.

"They're there. They've been waiting. They felt us coming the moment we achieved FTL." She grabbed my arm. "Chris, this is what Aramis warned about. What the Serpent feared. There ARE things in the dark. Old things. And they've been watching Earth for a very long time."

"Hostile?"

"I don't know. The timelines split too many ways. Some futures we make first contact and it's beautiful. Others..." She didn't need to finish.

Sophia took my hand. "Together?"

"Always."

The frequency opened between us. North and south poles. Solar and lunar. Ready for whatever came next.

Because humanity had prepared for this moment.

We were Gaia. We were one consciousness. We were Earth.

And we were about to discover we weren't alone in the universe.

"Open a channel," I said to Dr. Zin. "Let's see if they answer."

**THE ACADEMY** (Parallel Storyline)

Back on Earth, three thousand students gathered in Myanmar for the Academy's opening ceremony.

Ren stood before them, looking at faces from every nation. Every culture. All awakened. All ready to learn.

"Welcome to the Academy of Consciousness," he said. "Over the next year, you'll learn what the Twelve taught Chris. Astral projection. Timeline reading. Mass amplification. Etheric combat. Everything you'll need to help Earth heal and prepare for what's coming."

In the front row, a student raised her hand. Young. Maybe nineteen. Intense eyes.

"Is it true?" she asked. "The rumors. That Chris is... the Pattern? The Christ Consciousness returned?"

Ren smiled. "Some things can only be lived, not spoken. But I'll tell you this: Chris is on a ship right now, about to make first contact with whatever's at Proxima Centauri. He's facing the unknown with Sophia and the crew. Meanwhile, you're here, learning to hold Earth's frequency while they're gone."

"So we're not here to worship him," another student said. "We're here to become like him."

"Better than him," Ren corrected. "He'd want that. The Pattern isn't about one person being special. It's about everyone remembering they're Source. Chris catalyzed the awakening. You're the ones who'll sustain it. Evolve it. Take it further than he could imagine."

The students exchanged glances. Something shifting in their collective energy.

"When do we start?" someone asked.

Ren's eyes gleamed. "Now. Close your eyes. Feel for the frequency. And let me show you what's possible when consciousness works as one..."

*The frequency expands.*
*We are all one.*
