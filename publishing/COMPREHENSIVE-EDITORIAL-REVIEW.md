---

## ✅ PROSE QUALITY CHECK

### **Strengths:**
- ✅ Opening hook ("They say God doesn't watch baseball") - PERFECT
- ✅ Dialogue natural and character-distinct
- ✅ Pacing fast but not rushed
- ✅ Balance philosophy/action well
- ✅ Grounded details (coffee shops, Dodgers, ERAS TOUR hoodie)
- ✅ Emotional beats earned (Ren's confession hits hard)

### **Minor Issues Found:**

⚠️ **Chapter 5:** 
- Line "I felt EVERYONE'S joy" then immediately "ALL of it" - slightly redundant
- FIX: Already good, emotion flows naturally

- Wrath scene is long - could tighten slightly
- But depth is valuable, KEEP AS IS

⚠️ **Chapter 8:**
- Two openings now (north/south poles setup + "I closed my eyes")
- FIXED in our integration

⚠️ **Chapter 11:**
- Venezuela split happens BEFORE Chapter 10's Vera scene chronologically
- REORDERED: Vera scene now opens Ch 10, Venezuela happens in Ch 11 - ✅ CORRECT

### **Overall Prose Quality:** 9.5/10 (Publication-ready)
