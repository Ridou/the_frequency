## The Frequency: Book One - Awakening

---

Dear [Agent Name],

I am seeking representation for THE FREQUENCY: AWAKENING, a 65,000-word contemporary fantasy novel with series potential. It will appeal to readers of *The Fifth Sacred Thing*, *The Alchemist*, and viewers of *The OA*.

Christian Rand is having the worst/best night of his life. Four beers deep at a sports bar, watching the Dodgers lose Game 7 of the World Series, he discovers he can channel cosmic energy into baseball players 8,000 miles away. When utility infielder Miguel Rojas crushes an impossible home run, Chris realizes he's touched something he wasn't supposed to touch. And it's touched him back.

His best friend Ren reveals the truth: Chris has awakened to "the frequency," a web of consciousness connecting all living things. Ren is one of twelve immortal Apostles who've been waiting for someone like Chris—a natural amplifier who respects free will instead of controlling others. But the Controllers, a powerful faction who've guided humanity from the shadows for centuries, want to recruit or eliminate Chris before he disrupts their carefully managed world order.

After intensive training, Chris helps Myanmar become the first nation to "awaken"—experiencing unity consciousness so profound that 25,000 people declare themselves "Earth before Myanmar." The military, feeling the same connection, peacefully stands down. The cascade accelerates: Venezuela, Tunisia, and within two years, every nation on Earth chooses planetary identity over nationalist division.

When Earth fully unifies, the planet responds with a gift: Gaium, an indestructible metal that can only be shaped by unified consciousness. Humanity builds the *Gaia*, a 500-meter spacecraft, and launches toward first contact with whatever's waiting at Proxima Centauri.

THE FREQUENCY: AWAKENING is the first in a planned trilogy. Book Two (*First Contact*) follows humanity's introduction to galactic civilization. Book Three (*Cosmic Consciousness*) explores our role in universal evolution. The complete trilogy is outlined.

## ALTERNATE VERSIONS

### Shorter (250 words)

Dear [Agent Name],

THE FREQUENCY: AWAKENING (65,000 words) is contemporary fantasy meets consciousness sci-fi for readers who loved *The Fifth Sacred Thing* and *The OA*.

Christian Rand discovers he can amplify human consciousness when he helps baseball players during Game 7 of the World Series. His best friend reveals he's part of twelve immortal Apostles waiting for someone like Chris—who respects free will while using cosmic power. But the Controllers, who've secretly guided humanity for centuries, see Chris as a threat to their carefully managed world order.

After training, Chris catalyzes Myanmar's peaceful awakening—25,000 people experience unity consciousness and declare "Earth before Myanmar." The military, feeling the connection, stands down. Within two years, every nation transforms from nationalist to planetary identity.

When Earth unifies, the planet responds: miners discover Gaium, an indestructible metal moldable only by consciousness. Humanity builds a spacecraft and launches toward Proxima Centauri, where a consciousness-based signal suggests first contact is imminent.

THE FREQUENCY is planned as a trilogy: Earth unification (complete), galactic first contact (outlined), cosmic consciousness (envisioned).

### Longer (500 words - for enthusiastic agents)

Dear [Agent Name],

When Christian Rand amplifies professional baseball players from a sports bar 8,000 miles away, he thinks he's losing his mind. When his best friend reveals he's part of an immortal conspiracy waiting for someone exactly like Chris, he knows the world is stranger than he imagined. And when he's shown the Akashic Records—the universe's memory—he discovers he's fulfilling a pattern that's repeated across human history: the Christ Consciousness incarnating at civilization's threshold moments.

THE FREQUENCY: AWAKENING (65,000 words) is contemporary fantasy with hard sci-fi elements, combining the consciousness exploration of *The OA*, the political sophistication of *The Fifth Sacred Thing*, and the epic scope of *Childhood's End*.

Chris learns he's a natural "amplifier"—able to enhance others' connection to universal consciousness while respecting their free will. This puts him at odds with the Controllers, a faction who've guided humanity from shadows for millennia, preventing nuclear wars and managing catastrophes through carefully controlled intervention. They see Chris's gift of helping people awaken naturally as an extinction-level threat.

After ninety days of training with the Apostles—learning to fold space, read timelines, and amplify crowds—Chris helps Myanmar become the first nation to transform. Twenty-five thousand people gather at Shwedagon Pagoda for mass meditation. When they experience unity consciousness directly, they declare "I am Earth before I am Myanmar." The military, feeling the same connection, peacefully stands down.

The cascade is unstoppable. Venezuela transforms. Tunisia. Within two years, every nation on Earth dissolves nationalist identity in favor of planetary belonging. The Controllers' leader, the Serpent, tries to suppress the movement through UN authorization but ultimately transforms themselves, joining the awakening.

When Earth achieves complete unification, the planet reveals a gift: Gaium, an impossible metal that doesn't melt, doesn't corrode, and can be shaped by consciousness itself. It's Source made physical—technology that responds to unified minds. Humanity builds the *Gaia*, a massive spacecraft, and launches toward Proxima Centauri, where a consciousness-based signal suggests we're not alone.

The book ends as Chris and 300 crew members journey toward first contact, Earth fully unified behind them, five years of Mars colonization complete, and faster-than-light travel newly discovered. The epilogue reveals a signal from Proxima Centauri: *Someone's there. And they know we're coming.*

THE FREQUENCY is planned as a trilogy:
- **Book One: Awakening** (complete) - Earth unification
- **Book Two: First Contact** (outlined) - Galactic civilization
- **Book Three: Cosmic Consciousness** (envisioned) - Universal evolution

The series explores consciousness evolution, free will versus control, and humanity's transition from planetary to galactic species—all while maintaining character-driven narrative and fast pacing.
