## Abilities & Powers

### Natural Gift: Sanctuary Creation

**How It Works:**
- Can make spaces SAFE on frequency level
- Not invisibility (like Miriam/Rook)
- But: Controllers can't FEEL the space
- Like acoustic deadening for consciousness

**Applications:**
- Safe houses for awakeners
- Meeting spaces Controller-proof
- Refugee routes protected
- Allows people to rest, to heal, to organize

**Mechanics:**
- Creates frequency "blanket" around space
- Soft, warm, protective energy
- Doesn't hide - just makes you not NOTICE
- Mother's love as defensive field

### Learned Abilities

**Collective Shielding:**
- Protects groups (not just spaces)
- Can shield 50-100 people simultaneously
- Exhausting but effective
- Has saved thousands from Controller manipulation

**Hope Amplification:**
- Not forced hope (that would be manipulation)
- But: Helps people remember their OWN hope
- Reminds them why they're trying
- Gentle nudge toward their own light

**Practical Healing:**
- Not medical (but somehow people feel better around her)
- Emotional/spiritual healing through presence
- Holds space for grief, for trauma, for integration
- The wounded come to her (she makes room)

**Network Coordination:**
- Natural organizer (Soviet survival skill)
- Coordinates thousands without technology sometimes
- Knows who needs what, where resources are
- Living hub of Eastern European resistance

### Limitations

- Sanctuary requires her presence (can't be everywhere)
- Shielding drains her (needs rest she doesn't take)
- Hope amplification doesn't work on those who've chosen despair
- Can't protect from physical threats (only frequency-level)
