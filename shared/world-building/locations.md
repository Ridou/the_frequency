## Future Locations (To Be Developed)

### Controller Headquarters
- **Location:** Unknown (possibly downtown LA?)
- **Nature:** To be determined
- **Access:** Unknown
- **Status:** Not yet visited

### Other Training Sites
- Various LA locations for different lessons
- Natural spaces vs. urban spaces
- Each Apostle might have preferred location

### The Archive
- Potential location where Jin keeps records
- Physical or frequency-based?
- To be determined

### Safe Houses
- Where Apostles can protect Chris
- Multiple locations for security
- To be developed as threat increases

---

## Location Themes

### Regular World
- Grounded, specific, recognizable LA locations
- Real places readers could visit
- Blend of public (parks, observatory) and private (apartments)

### Frequency World
- Impossible geometry
- Accessed through folds
- Exists in liminal times/spaces
- More symbolic/archetypal

### The Blend
- Regular locations used for frequency work
- Reality is thinner in some places
- Early morning/late night = easier access
- Natural spaces vs. built spaces

---

## Location Rules

### Creating Folds
- Requires advanced skill
- Easier at certain times (city dreaming, 3 AM)
- Natural thresholds work better (water, parks)
- Can create anywhere but costs more in wrong places

### Frequency Hot Spots
- Some places naturally amplify frequency
- Water features (Echo Park Lake)
- High overlook points (Griffith Observatory)
- Old places with history
- Places many people have invested emotion

### Grounding Locations
- Normal, mundane places anchor reality
- Coffee shops, homes, familiar spaces
- Important for not getting lost in frequency
- Vale's teaching: choose to walk sometimes

---

## Future Book Locations

### Book Two (Potential)
- Other cities as movement grows
- International locations
- First changed community/town
- Controller strongholds

### Book Three (Potential)
- UN or similar for GAIA formation
- Space-related locations (launch site, etc.)
- Unified Earth capital
- The spacecraft

---

## Notes for Development

- Keep using real LA locations (authenticity)
- Research neighborhoods Chris might live in
- Consider commute to work (tech support job)
- Where would Apostles individually live?
- What other cities have strong frequency presence?
- Natural features that amplify frequency
- Urban areas that dampen or amplify
- Historical sites with accumulated consciousness

### Research Needed
- LA neighborhoods and their character
- Public parks and their features
- Coffee shops (potential real inspirations)
- Sports bars (McHenry's characteristics)
- Commute patterns (if Chris has job)
